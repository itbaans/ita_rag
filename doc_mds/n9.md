**Comprehensive Notes: Attempts to Solve Subcontinent's Problems (1940-1947)**

**Central Question:** How successful were attempts to find solutions to the problems facing the subcontinent in the years 1940 to 1947?

**Overall Assessment:** The period 1940-1947 witnessed numerous attempts by the British government, the Indian National Congress (INC), and the All-India Muslim League (AIML) to find a political solution for the future of British India. Most of these attempts, particularly those aimed at preserving a united India acceptable to all major parties, were **unsuccessful**. Growing communal divisions, conflicting visions for the future, and the pressures of World War II ultimately led to partition as the final, albeit tragic and violent, "solution."

**1. The Second World War (1939–45) in relation to India and the ‘Quit India’ Movement**

- **Context:** In September 1939, the British Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, declared India at war with Germany without consulting Indian political leaders. This unilateral decision was deeply resented by the INC, which argued that a country fighting for democracy abroad should practice it at home.
- **INC Response:** The INC demanded immediate independence as a condition for cooperation in the war effort. When refused, its ministries in eight provinces resigned in protest (October-November 1939).
- **AIML Response:** The Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, observed a "Day of Deliverance" celebrating the resignation of Congress ministries, highlighting the growing distrust. The League offered conditional support to the British, hoping to gain political leverage.
- **‘Quit India’ Movement (August 1942):** Launched by Mahatma Gandhi and the INC following the failure of the Cripps Mission. It was a call for immediate British withdrawal ("Quit India" or _Bharat Chhodo_). It involved mass civil disobedience, strikes, and protests.
- **British Reaction:** The movement was met with swift and severe repression. The entire INC leadership, including Gandhi, Nehru, and Patel, was arrested and imprisoned for most of the remaining war years. Thousands were killed, and tens of thousands arrested.
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Failure (in achieving immediate independence):** The movement was crushed militarily and failed to force the British out during the war.
    - **Failure (in finding a solution):** It deepened the political deadlock. The imprisonment of INC leaders created a political vacuum that the Muslim League effectively utilized to consolidate its position and propagate the demand for Pakistan. It further alienated the British and the AIML from the INC.
    - **Limited Success (long-term):** It demonstrated the depth of nationalist sentiment and arguably convinced the British that holding onto India post-war would be untenable.

---

**2. The Pakistan Resolution (1940)**

- **Context:** Held during the AIML's annual session in Lahore in March 1940. It emerged from the growing fear among Muslims of Hindu domination in a future independent, united India (based on the "Two-Nation Theory" – that Hindus and Muslims were distinct nations).
- **The Resolution:** It formally demanded that "geographically contiguous units are demarcated into regions which should be so constituted, with such territorial readjustments as may be necessary, that the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in a majority as in the North Western and Eastern Zones of India should be grouped to constitute ‘Independent States’ in which the constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign." 1

- **Significance:** This became the defining goal of the Muslim League. Although initially ambiguous about one state or multiple, it firmly placed the demand for separate Muslim homeland(s) at the forefront of political negotiations.
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Success (for AIML):** Clearly articulated the League's primary objective and provided a powerful rallying cry that galvanized Muslim support.
    - **Failure (in finding a common solution):** It marked a fundamental break from the goal of a united independent India, making future negotiations significantly more complex and confrontational. It solidified the path towards separation.

**3. The Cripps Mission (1942)**

- **Context:** Sent by the British War Cabinet under Sir Stafford Cripps (a Labour politician sympathetic to Indian aspirations) amidst WWII pressures – specifically the advance of Japanese forces towards India's borders and pressure from the US to secure Indian cooperation.
- **Proposals:**
    1. Dominion status for India immediately after the war ended.
    2. A constitution-making body (Constituent Assembly) to be set up after the war, elected by provincial assemblies.
    3. Provinces unwilling to accept the new constitution could opt out and form a separate union with similar status (an implicit concession to the Pakistan demand).
    4. An interim arrangement where Indians would join the Viceroy's Executive Council, but Britain would retain control over defence.
- **Outcome:** Rejected by all major parties.
    - **INC:** Rejected it primarily because it offered Dominion status only _after_ the war (demanded immediate self-government) and opposed the provincial opt-out clause (seen as detrimental to Indian unity). Gandhi called it "a post-dated cheque on a crashing bank."
    - **AIML:** Rejected it because the proposals did not explicitly accept the principle of Pakistan and the mechanism for separation was unclear.
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Failure:** Completely failed to secure Indian cooperation for the war or to agree on a future constitutional framework. It further exposed the irreconcilable differences between the INC, AIML, and the British. Its failure directly led to the launch of the Quit India Movement.

---

**4. The Gandhi–Jinnah Talks (1944)**

- **Context:** Held in Bombay (Mumbai) between Mahatma Gandhi (recently released from prison on health grounds) and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. An attempt to bridge the divide based on the "Rajagopalachari Formula," which proposed:
    1. AIML would cooperate with INC in forming an interim government.
    2. After the war, a commission would demarcate contiguous districts in the North-West and North-East where Muslims were an absolute majority.
    3. A plebiscite of _all_ inhabitants in these areas would decide on separation.
    4. If separation was decided, agreements would be made for defence, commerce, etc.
    5. These terms were conditional on Britain transferring full power to India.
- **Outcome:** The talks failed comprehensively.
    - **Jinnah's Stance:** Insisted on the "Two-Nation Theory" – Muslims were a separate nation and must be recognized as such _before_ independence. Demanded Pakistan based on the existing boundaries of the six Muslim-majority provinces (Punjab, NWFP, Sindh, Balochistan, Bengal, Assam). Rejected plebiscite involving non-Muslims.
    - **Gandhi's Stance:** Spoke for a united India. Insisted that any separation could only occur _after_ British withdrawal and should be decided by the inhabitants of the concerned areas. Could not accept the Two-Nation Theory.
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Failure:** Demonstrated the fundamental and seemingly unbridgeable ideological gap between the two leaders and their parties regarding the concept of nationhood and the mechanism/timing for any potential partition. Showed that personal dialogue between the top leaders could not overcome these structural political differences.

---

**5. Lord Wavell and the Simla Conference (1945)**

- **Context:** Lord Wavell replaced Linlithgow as Viceroy in 1943. With the end of WWII in sight, he sought to break the political stalemate and form a representative Executive Council to govern India until a new constitution was agreed upon.
- **Wavell Plan (June 1945):** Proposed the formation of a new Executive Council where all members, except the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, would be Indians. There would be equal representation ('parity') for 'caste Hindus' and Muslims.
- **Simla Conference (June-July 1945):** A meeting of 21 Indian political leaders invited by Wavell to discuss the plan.
- **Outcome:** The conference collapsed due to deadlock between the INC and AIML.
    - **AIML's Stance (Jinnah):** Insisted that _only_ the Muslim League had the right to nominate _all_ Muslim members to the Council.
    - **INC's Stance:** Objected strongly, as it claimed to represent all Indians, including Muslims (Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was the Congress President at the time). It wanted to nominate Muslim members as well. Unionist Party of Punjab also wanted representation.
    - **Wavell's Decision:** Wavell could not accept Jinnah's demand (which excluded non-League Muslims) and dissolved the conference.
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Failure:** Failed to create an interim government and further highlighted the AIML's claim to be the sole representative of Indian Muslims, a claim the INC could not accept. It solidified the political impasse and demonstrated the difficulty of achieving Hindu-Muslim parity within a united framework when the definition of representation itself was contested.

---

**6. The Elections of 1945–46**

- **Context:** Called by the British Labour government (which came to power in July 1945) to test the claims of representation by different parties and to elect provincial and central legislatures that would form the basis for a future constitution-making body.
- **Campaigns:** Fought intensely on the core issue: United India (INC) vs. Pakistan (AIML).
- **Results:** A decisive but divided verdict.
    - **Central Legislative Assembly:** INC won 57 out of 102 elected seats. AIML won _all 30 seats reserved for Muslims_.
    - **Provincial Assemblies:** INC won majorities in 8 provinces. AIML won 425 out of 496 seats reserved for Muslims (approx. 87%), securing majorities in Bengal and Sindh. Crucially, it demonstrated overwhelming support among the Muslim electorate. In Punjab, it became the largest single party but couldn't form a government alone initially (a coalition under the Unionists took power briefly).
- **Reasons for Muslim League Success:**
    1. **Clear Platform:** The simple, powerful demand for Pakistan resonated strongly with Muslim anxieties about the future.
    2. **Effective Organization & Propaganda:** The League successfully mobilized voters around the "Two-Nation Theory" and fears of "Hindu Raj."
    3. **Religious Appeal:** Use of religious symbols and rhetoric played a significant role.
    4. **Weakening of Alternatives:** The Unionist Party in Punjab was weakened; Congress's appeal among Muslims was limited.
    5. **Reaction to Congress Rule (1937-39):** Lingering Muslim grievances about perceived discrimination during Congress provincial rule (whether fully justified or not) were effectively exploited.
- **Consequences & Impact on British Attempts:**
    - The results undeniably established the Muslim League as the dominant political force among Indian Muslims and legitimized Jinnah's claim to speak for them.
    - The demand for Pakistan could no longer be dismissed by the British or the INC as representing only a minority view among Muslims.
    - **This dramatically changed British calculations.** It became clear that any solution attempting to maintain a united India _had_ to secure the AIML's agreement, which now seemed impossible without significant concessions towards autonomy or separation. This reality heavily influenced the structure of the subsequent Cabinet Mission Plan.

---

**7. The Cabinet Mission Plan (1946)**

- **Context:** Sent by the British Labour government (Attlee) comprising three cabinet ministers (Pethick-Lawrence, Stafford Cripps, A.V. Alexander). It was the last major attempt to transfer power to a _united_ India while addressing the demands raised by the election results.
- **Proposals (May 1946):**
    1. **Rejection of Pakistan:** The Mission explicitly rejected the demand for a sovereign Pakistan due to the difficulty of drawing boundaries and the large non-Muslim minorities that would remain in Pakistan (and Muslim minorities in India).
    2. **Three-Tier Structure:** Proposed a complex federal structure:
        - **Union Centre:** Limited powers (Defence, Foreign Affairs, Communications).
        - **Provinces:** All other powers resided here.
        - **Provincial Groupings:** Provinces were grouped into three sections:
            - **Section A:** Hindu-majority provinces (Madras, Bombay, UP, Bihar, CP, Orissa).
            - **Section B:** Muslim-majority provinces in the North-West (Punjab, NWFP, Sindh).
            - **Section C:** Muslim-majority provinces in the North-East (Bengal, Assam).
        - Provinces would first meet in sections to decide their group constitutions, then meet as a whole for the Union constitution. Provinces could opt out of their group after the first general election under the new constitution.
    3. **Interim Government:** Immediate formation of an interim government with representation from major parties.
    4. **Constituent Assembly:** To be elected by provincial assemblies to frame the constitution.
- **Outcome:** Initial acceptance, followed by breakdown.
    - **AIML:** Accepted the plan (June 6) seeing the compulsory groupings (especially B and C) as a potential pathway to achieving Pakistan in the future.
    - **INC:** Accepted the plan (June 24) but rejected the compulsory grouping interpretation, arguing provinces could choose _not_ to join a group from the outset. Nehru's subsequent press statement (July 10) emphasizing that Congress was entering the Constituent Assembly "unfettered by agreements" and could modify the plan further alarmed the League.
    - **Breakdown:** AIML withdrew its acceptance (July 29), citing INC's interpretation and Nehru's remarks as evidence of bad faith. Disagreements over the composition of the Interim Government (parity issues again) also contributed.
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Failure:** Despite its intricate design to balance unity and autonomy, the plan failed due to deep-seated mistrust and conflicting interpretations between the INC and AIML. It was the final serious attempt at a united solution, and its failure made partition almost inevitable.

---

**8. Direct Action Day (16 August 1946)**

- **Context:** Called by the Muslim League after withdrawing acceptance of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Jinnah proclaimed it as a day to demonstrate Muslim solidarity and strength in support of the demand for Pakistan. While intended by the leadership perhaps as peaceful hartals (strikes) and meetings, the call was interpreted differently on the ground.
- **Outcome:** Led to unprecedented communal violence, particularly in Calcutta (Kolkata), known as the "Great Calcutta Killing." Riots between Hindus and Muslims lasted for several days, resulting in thousands of deaths (estimates vary from 5,000 to over 10,000) and widespread destruction. Violence spread to other areas like Noakhali (Bengal), Bihar, and the United Provinces.
- **Significance:** It marked a terrifying escalation of communal tensions. It destroyed any remaining hope for Hindu-Muslim cooperation within a single state for many. It demonstrated the potential for mass violence if a political settlement was not reached quickly. It significantly hardened attitudes on all sides and convinced many, including the British, that partition might be necessary to avoid full-scale civil war.
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Tragic Failure:** As a means of finding a peaceful solution, it was a disaster. It achieved the opposite, unleashing horrific violence and making a negotiated, united settlement impossible. It drastically accelerated the momentum towards partition.

---

**9. The June 3 Plan / Mountbatten Plan (1947)**

- **Context:** Lord Mountbatten arrived as the last Viceroy in March 1947 with a mandate from the Attlee government to transfer power by June 1948 (later accelerated). Faced with escalating violence and the complete breakdown of trust following Direct Action Day and the failure of the Interim Government (formed in Sept 1946 but boycotted initially by AIML, then joined but didn't cooperate), Mountbatten concluded partition was the only viable option.
- **The Plan (Announced June 3, 1947):**
    1. Principle of Partition accepted. British India would be divided into two dominions: India and Pakistan.
    2. Provincial assemblies of Bengal and Punjab would meet in two parts (Muslim-majority districts and non-Muslim majority districts) to vote on partition. If either part voted for partition, the province would be divided.
    3. A referendum would be held in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) to decide which dominion to join.
    4. A referendum would be held in the Sylhet district of Assam to decide if it would join East Bengal (Pakistan).
    5. Princely states would be free to accede to either dominion or remain independent (though independence was discouraged).
    6. A Boundary Commission would be set up to demarcate the final borders in partitioned provinces.
    7. Transfer of power date advanced dramatically to **August 15, 1947**.
- **Outcome:** Accepted by INC (represented by Nehru, Patel), AIML (Jinnah), and Sikh leaders (Baldev Singh). Acceptance was reluctant for INC and Sikhs (who saw it as tragic but unavoidable) and for Jinnah (who lamented receiving a "moth-eaten" Pakistan, as Bengal and Punjab were partitioned).
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Limited Success:** It _did_ provide a mechanism for the transfer of power and ended the political deadlock, creating the two states. It achieved the British goal of withdrawal.
    - **Failure (in preventing violence/ensuring fairness):** It confirmed partition, which led to immense human suffering. The extreme speed of the process contributed significantly to the chaos, violence, and mass displacement during partition. It did not solve the underlying communal problem but rather gave it a territorial dimension.

**10. The Radcliffe Commission and Award (1947)**

- **Context:** Established under the June 3 Plan to determine the specific boundaries between India and Pakistan in Punjab and Bengal, based on contiguous majority areas of Muslims and non-Muslims, while also considering "other factors" (like infrastructure, communication lines, water resources).
- **Process:** Headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a British lawyer who had never visited India before. He was given only five weeks to complete the task, working with outdated maps and census data, under intense political pressure from all sides. The Commissions for Punjab and Bengal each had four judges (two nominated by INC, two by AIML), but they inevitably deadlocked, leaving Radcliffe to make the final decisions.
- **The Award:** The boundary lines were finalized by August 12 but were deliberately announced by Mountbatten only on **August 17, 1947**, two days _after_ independence. This was done ostensibly to avoid confusion and ensure the British were not responsible for enforcing the controversial lines, but it contributed to chaos as migrations occurred based on speculation, and district administrations were unsure which country they belonged to on Independence Day.
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Largely a Failure:** While it produced _a_ boundary, the Award was highly controversial and flawed.
        - The haste and lack of local knowledge led to arbitrary divisions (e.g., villages separated from their fields, factories from power sources).
        - The "other factors" clause was applied inconsistently, leading to accusations of bias (e.g., awarding Gurdaspur district's Muslim-majority tehsils largely to India, providing India road access to Kashmir; awarding Chittagong Hill Tracts with a 97% non-Muslim population to Pakistan).
        - The late announcement exacerbated uncertainty and violence during partition migrations.
        - It created long-term border disputes (e.g., Kashmir's accession was complicated by the Gurdaspur award) and sowed the seeds of future conflict. It did not solve the problem of minorities on either side of the new borders.

---

**11. The Indian Independence Act (1947)**

- **Context:** Passed by the British Parliament in July 1947, giving legal effect to the June 3 Plan.
- **Provisions:**
    1. Created the two independent Dominions of India and Pakistan from August 15, 1947.
    2. Terminated British suzerainty over the princely states, leaving them free to accede to either dominion.
    3. Conferred complete legislative authority upon the respective Constituent Assemblies of the two dominions.
    4. Abolished the office of Secretary of State for India.
    5. Provided for the continuation of existing laws until the dominions' legislatures amended them.
    6. Designated Mountbatten as Governor-General of India (at INC's request) and Jinnah as Governor-General of Pakistan (AIML's choice).
- **Success/Failure:**
    - **Success:** From a legal and constitutional standpoint, the Act was entirely successful. It formally ended British rule, established the two new independent states, and provided the legal framework for the transfer of power as intended by the Mountbatten Plan. It achieved its specific, limited goal of enacting independence and partition into law.

**Focus Area Conclusions:**

- **How successful were the meetings held during World War II to agree the future of the subcontinent?**
    
    - The key meetings held during WWII (Cripps Mission 1942, Gandhi-Jinnah Talks 1944, Simla Conference 1945) were **uniformly unsuccessful** in agreeing on the future of the subcontinent or even forming a stable interim arrangement.
    - **Reasons for Failure:** British reluctance to grant immediate independence during the war, the fundamental disagreement between INC (seeking unity) and AIML (demanding Pakistan), and the growing insistence by AIML on being recognized as the sole representative body for Muslims. These meetings highlighted and deepened the political divisions rather than resolving them.
- **How did the success of the Muslim League in the 1945–46 elections lead to changes in British attempts to solve the problems of the subcontinent?**
    
    - The overwhelming success of the Muslim League in winning nearly all Muslim seats in the 1945-46 elections was a **watershed moment**. It provided undeniable proof of widespread support for the Pakistan demand among the Muslim electorate.
    - **Change in British Approach:** Prior to the elections, the British and INC could arguably downplay the Pakistan demand as extremist or unrepresentative. After the elections, this was no longer politically feasible. The British were forced to acknowledge the AIML as the legitimate representative of Muslim political aspirations and accept that the demand for Pakistan had to be addressed directly in any future settlement.
    - **Influence on Later Plans:** This electoral mandate heavily influenced the Cabinet Mission Plan (1946), which, while rejecting full partition, included the complex provincial grouping system specifically designed to grant significant autonomy to Muslim-majority regions (Sections B and C) – a clear attempt to accommodate the League's demands short of full separation. When even this elaborate compromise failed, the election results provided the political justification for Mountbatten and the British government to conclude that partition (as outlined in the June 3 Plan) was the only remaining option to transfer power, however undesirable its consequences. The elections effectively killed the possibility of the British imposing a purely unitary solution against the demonstrated will of the majority of Muslim voters.
