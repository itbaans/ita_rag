### **1. Shah Waliullah Dehlavi: Religious Reforms and Role in the 18th Century Subcontinent**

**Introduction:** Shah Waliullah Dehlavi (1703-1762) stands as one of the most influential Islamic scholars and reformers in the history of the Indian subcontinent. Living during a period of profound political disintegration and social decay for Muslims, marked by the decline of the Mughal Empire, his intellectual contributions aimed to diagnose the causes of this decline and offer a comprehensive program for religious, social, and political renewal. His work laid the intellectual foundations for many subsequent Islamic revivalist movements in South Asia.

**Historical Context: The Crisis of 18th Century India**

- **Political Decline:** Shah Waliullah witnessed the rapid weakening of the Mughal Empire following the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. Successive emperors were weak and ineffective, often puppets in the hands of powerful nobles or external forces. Central authority collapsed, leading to provincial governors becoming virtually independent.  
    
- **External Threats and Internal Strife:** The subcontinent faced significant instability. Maratha power surged from the Deccan, challenging Mughal authority across vast swathes of India, including raids deep into the north. Sikh power was consolidating in the Punjab. Persian ruler Nadir Shah's devastating invasion and sack of Delhi in 1739 exposed the Empire's vulnerability. Later, Ahmad Shah Abdali's invasions from Afghanistan further destabilized the region. Internally, factionalism among Mughal nobles (often along ethnic lines like Irani vs. Turani) paralysed governance.  
    
- **Socio-Economic Decay:** Political instability led to economic disruption, breakdown of law and order, and increased exploitation of the peasantry. Trade routes were unsafe, and agricultural output suffered. This decline impacted the Muslim community, particularly the aristocracy and urban classes who were closely tied to the Mughal state structure.
- **Religious Stagnation and Division:** Shah Waliullah observed what he perceived as a deviation from 'true' Islamic principles.
    - **Syncretism:** Practices borrowed from local cultures, particularly Hinduism, had crept into Muslim popular religion (e.g., excessive veneration of saints/shrines, elaborate life-cycle rituals).
    - **Sectarianism:** Bitter conflicts existed between Sunni and Shia Muslims, weakening Muslim unity. Within Sunnism, rigid adherence (_taqlid_) to specific schools of law (Hanafi, Shafi'i, etc.) often led to disputes over minor issues, neglecting core principles.  
        
    - **Mysticism vs. Orthodoxy:** Tensions existed between some Sufi practices and strict interpretations of Sharia (Islamic law).
    - **Intellectual Stagnation:** There was a perceived lack of original thinking and _Ijtihad_ (independent reasoning based on primary sources) among scholars (_Ulema_).

**Shah Waliullah's Religious Reforms and Teachings:**

Shah Waliullah's approach was holistic, seeking to purify religious understanding and practice as the basis for broader societal revival.

- **Emphasis on Quran and Sunnah:** He stressed the paramount importance of returning to the foundational sources of Islam – the Quran and the authentic traditions (Sunnah) of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).  
    
- **Translation of the Quran:** Recognizing that most Muslims in India could not understand Arabic, he undertook the monumental task of translating the Quran into Persian, the administrative and scholarly language of the time. This was a revolutionary step, making the divine text accessible to a wider audience and encouraging direct engagement with its message, bypassing intermediaries. This act faced opposition from conservative Ulema who believed the Quran should only be read in Arabic.  
    
- **Reconciliation and Synthesis:**
    - **Different Schools of Law (Fiqh):** He studied various schools of Sunni jurisprudence and sought to bridge the differences between them, emphasizing shared principles and demonstrating that many disagreements were based on interpretation rather than fundamentals. His work _Al-Insaf fi Bayan Sabab al-Ikhtilaf_ (Justice in Explaining the Reasons for Disagreement) aimed at fostering tolerance and understanding.
    - **Sharia and Sufism (Tasawwuf):** While critical of deviant Sufi practices, Shah Waliullah was himself a respected Sufi of the Naqshbandi order. He argued that true Sufism was perfectly compatible with Sharia and, in fact, represented the inner, spiritual dimension of Islamic law. He sought to integrate the spiritual insights of Sufism with the legal framework of Sharia.  
        
    - **Reason and Revelation:** He believed in the harmony between reason (_aql_) and revelation (_naql_), arguing that Islamic teachings were rational and beneficial for human society.
- **Revival of Ijtihad:** He strongly advocated for the reopening of the gates of _Ijtihad_ – the use of independent scholarly reasoning to derive rulings from the primary sources for new situations. He criticized blind imitation (_taqlid_) and encouraged scholars to engage critically with the tradition.  
    
- **Socio-Economic Justice:** Shah Waliullah linked religious decline to social and economic imbalances. He emphasized Islamic principles of economic justice, fair distribution of wealth, condemnation of hoarding and luxurious extravagance (especially among the elite), and the importance of productive labour for societal well-being. He believed social equilibrium (_tawazun_) was essential.  
    
- **Concept of _Tatbiq_ (Integration):** A key aspect of his thought was _tatbiq_, the effort to synthesize and harmonize apparently conflicting views or traditions within Islam, whether between different schools of law, Sufism and Sharia, or reason and revelation.  
    

**Political Role and Vision:**

While primarily a scholar, Shah Waliullah was deeply concerned about the political plight of Muslims.

- **Diagnosis of Decline:** He attributed Muslim political decline to moral decay, internal divisions, deviation from Islamic principles, and ineffective leadership.
- **Call for Unity and Action:** He wrote letters to various Muslim nobles, rulers, and influential figures, urging them to overcome their differences, unite, and restore just governance based on Islamic principles.
- **Invitation to Ahmad Shah Abdali:** Most famously, he is credited with (or believed by many to have) invited the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali to intervene in India to crush the rising Maratha power, which he saw as a major threat to Muslim political existence in North India. This culminated in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), where Abdali decisively defeated the Marathas. While this checked Maratha expansion northwards temporarily, it did not restore Mughal power, and Abdali himself did not stay to rule. The long-term consequences of this invitation remain debated by historians.  
    
- **Ideal Islamic State:** His vision was not necessarily the restoration of the Mughal dynasty in its previous form, but the establishment of a state governed according to the principles of the Quran and Sunnah, ensuring justice, stability, and the well-being of the Muslim community.

**Legacy and Influence:**

Shah Waliullah's influence on subsequent Islamic thought and movements in South Asia is immense:

- His emphasis on the Quran and Sunnah became a cornerstone of revivalist movements.
- His translation of the Quran paved the way for further translations into Urdu and other regional languages, democratizing access to the scripture.
- His call for _Ijtihad_ inspired later scholars to engage more dynamically with Islamic law.
- His sons, particularly Shah Abdul Aziz, Shah Abdul Qadir, and Shah Rafiuddin, continued his mission of teaching, translation, and reform.  
    
- His ideas directly influenced Syed Ahmad Barelvi and the Jihad Movement (Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya).  
    
- The Deobandi movement, founded in the later 19th century, drew heavily upon his theological and legal framework.
- He remains a revered figure across various Islamic schools of thought in South Asia, recognized for his intellectual depth, synthesizing approach, and profound concern for the Muslim community's spiritual and temporal well-being during a critical period.

### **2. Syed Ahmad Barelvi and the Revival of Islam in the Subcontinent**

**Introduction:** Syed Ahmad (1786-1831), often known as Syed Ahmad Barelvi or Syed Ahmad Shaheed ("the Martyr"), was a charismatic religious preacher and reformist leader in early 19th century India. Deeply influenced by the teachings of Shah Waliullah, particularly through his son Shah Abdul Aziz, Syed Ahmad spearheaded a major Islamic revivalist movement known as the _Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya_ (The Way of Muhammad). His movement aimed to purify Islamic practices from perceived innovations and non-Islamic influences and ultimately sought to establish an Islamic state free from non-Muslim control, culminating in the Jihad Movement against the Sikh Empire in Punjab.  

**Historical Context: Early 19th Century India**

- **British Expansion:** The British East India Company's power was rapidly expanding across the subcontinent. While direct British rule was not yet established everywhere, their political and military influence was pervasive, and they were progressively dismantling or subordinating existing Indian polities. Many Muslims felt their political power, cultural identity, and religious freedom were increasingly threatened.  
    
- **Sikh Rule in Punjab:** In the northwest, Maharaja Ranjit Singh had consolidated a powerful Sikh Empire centered in Punjab. While sometimes tolerant, Sikh rule imposed restrictions on certain Muslim practices (like the public call to prayer in some areas) and was perceived by figures like Syed Ahmad as oppressive non-Muslim domination over a historically Muslim region.
- **Continuing Influence of Shah Waliullah's Ideas:** Shah Waliullah's concerns about religious syncretism, moral laxity, and political decline continued to resonate. His son, Shah Abdul Aziz, was a leading scholar in Delhi and declared India under British influence as _Dar-ul-Harb_ (Abode of War), a significant declaration implying that the conditions for normal Islamic life were compromised. Syed Ahmad was a devoted disciple of Shah Abdul Aziz.  
    
- **Perceived Religious Decay:** Syed Ahmad and his followers observed widespread practices among Muslims that they considered un-Islamic (_bid'ah_ - innovations, or _shirk_ - polytheistic association):
    - Excessive veneration of Sufi saints and their tombs (pirism, grave worship).
    - Elaborate and costly ceremonies associated with births, marriages, and deaths, often influenced by local customs.
    - Belief in superstitions and seeking intercession through means other than direct prayer to God.
    - Neglect of fundamental Islamic obligations (_fara'id_).

**Syed Ahmad Barelvi's Teachings and Revivalist Message:**

Syed Ahmad's message was one of purification, return to fundamentals, and active struggle (_jihad_) for the supremacy of Islam.

- **Emphasis on _Tawhid_ (Oneness of God):** This was the absolute cornerstone of his preaching. He vehemently denounced any practice that seemed to compromise the absolute oneness and sovereignty of Allah, particularly those associated with popular Sufism and shrine veneration.
- **Rejection of _Bid'ah_ and _Shirk_:** He launched a strong critique against all practices not explicitly sanctioned by the Quran and the authentic Sunnah. His followers were urged to abandon customs seen as borrowings from Hinduism or local traditions.  
    
- **Direct Relationship with God:** He encouraged believers to establish a direct connection with God through prayer and adherence to the Sharia, minimizing the role of intermediaries (like pirs).
- **Importance of Sunnah:** Following the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) way of life in all aspects was emphasized. The movement's name, _Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya_, reflected this focus.
- **Call for _Jihad_:** Syed Ahmad believed that mere preaching and reform were insufficient in a situation where Muslims were politically subjugated by non-Muslims (first the Sikhs, and implicitly the British). He interpreted _Jihad_ not just as inner struggle but also as armed struggle to establish an Islamic state where Sharia could be fully implemented and Muslims could live freely according to their faith. This state would serve as a base for liberating other parts of India.  
    
- **Moral and Social Reform:** Alongside theological purification, he stressed adherence to Islamic ethics, simplicity in lifestyle, and social responsibility within the community.  
    

**The _Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya_ Movement:**

- **Preaching Tours:** Syed Ahmad travelled extensively across North India (Rohilkhand, Doab, Bihar, Bengal) attracting a large and diverse following. His charisma, piety, and powerful oratory resonated with many Muslims disillusioned with the prevailing conditions. His followers included scholars, peasants, artisans, and former soldiers.
- **Key Associates:** He gathered a group of committed companions, most notably Shah Ismail Shaheed (grandson of Shah Waliullah) and Maulvi Abdul Hai (son-in-law of Shah Abdul Aziz). Shah Ismail was a brilliant scholar and provided much of the intellectual and theological firepower for the movement, authoring influential works like _Taqwiyat-ul-Iman_ (Strengthening the Faith).  
    
- **Organizational Structure:** The movement developed a network for recruitment, fund-raising, and communication across different regions. Pledges of allegiance (_bay'ah_) were taken, similar to Sufi orders but focused on reform and Jihad.
- **_Hijra_ (Migration):** Following the Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) example, Syed Ahmad declared a _hijra_ in 1826 from British-controlled territory (seen as _Dar-ul-Harb_) to the North-West Frontier region (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan). This area, inhabited by Pashtun tribes, was largely outside direct Sikh or British control and strategically located adjacent to the Sikh Empire. The goal was to establish a base for launching the Jihad.

**Impact on Islamic Revival:**

- **Widespread Influence:** The _Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya_ had a significant impact, popularizing the ideas of religious purification and rejection of syncretic practices across North India and beyond. It raised Islamic consciousness among the masses.
- **Focus on Fundamentals:** The movement reinforced the centrality of _Tawhid_ and the Sunnah in Muslim religious life.
- **Foundation for Future Movements:** Although the Jihad movement itself ultimately failed in its immediate military objective, the ideas and fervor generated by Syed Ahmad and his companions inspired later Islamic movements, both reformist and political, in the subcontinent. The emphasis on resisting non-Muslim domination became a recurring theme.
- **Controversy:** The movement's strict interpretation of Islam and condemnation of popular practices alienated some Muslims. Its militant aspect and eventual conflict also drew criticism and generated controversy that continues in some interpretations of South Asian Islamic history.

**Conclusion:** Syed Ahmad Barelvi was a pivotal figure in the 19th-century Islamic revival in India. His _Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya_ movement represented a powerful response to the perceived religious decay and political subjugation of Muslims. By emphasizing _Tawhid_, adherence to the Sunnah, and advocating for _Jihad_, he mobilized a significant following and left a lasting legacy on Islamic consciousness and activism in the subcontinent, even though his ultimate political goal remained unfulfilled during his lifetime.

### **3. The Jihad Movement and the Mujahideen (Associated with Syed Ahmad Barelvi)**

**Introduction:** The Jihad Movement, also known as the Mujahideen Movement or _Tehreek-e-Mujahideen_, refers specifically to the armed struggle phase of Syed Ahmad Barelvi's _Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya_. Launched in the late 1820s from the North-West Frontier region, its primary objective was to wage _jihad_ against the Sikh Empire of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in Punjab, with the ultimate aim of establishing an Islamic state governed by Sharia law. The fighters in this movement were known as Mujahideen (those who strive or struggle in the path of God).  

**Origins and Objectives:**

- **Continuation of Revivalism:** The Jihad Movement was the practical, militant expression of Syed Ahmad Barelvi's revivalist ideology. Having concluded that peaceful preaching alone was insufficient under non-Muslim rule (Sikhs in Punjab, British elsewhere), armed struggle became the chosen path.  
    
- **_Hijra_ as Prelude:** The migration (_hijra_) of Syed Ahmad and hundreds of his followers from India to the Frontier region in 1826 was the necessary first step. This region was chosen for its relative independence from Sikh and British control, its proximity to Punjab, and its population of martial Pashtun tribes who Syed Ahmad hoped to rally to his cause.
- **Targeting the Sikh Empire:** The immediate target was Ranjit Singh's Sikh kingdom. This was due to its geographical proximity to the Frontier base, its status as a non-Muslim power ruling over a large Muslim population, and reported restrictions on Muslim religious practices within its territory. Syed Ahmad envisioned liberating Punjab first, establishing an Islamic state, and potentially using it as a springboard to challenge British power later.  
    
- **Establishing an Islamic State:** The core objective was not just military victory but the creation of a model Islamic state run strictly according to the Quran and Sunnah, free from perceived corruption, innovation, and non-Muslim political domination.

**Organization and Activities of the Mujahideen:**

- **Leadership:** Syed Ahmad Barelvi was the supreme leader (Imam and Amir-ul-Mu'minin). Key commanders and ideologues included Shah Ismail Shaheed and Maulvi Abdul Hai.
- **Recruitment:** Mujahideen were recruited from various parts of India, particularly Rohilkhand, Bihar, and Bengal, travelling often arduous journeys to reach the Frontier base. Local Pashtun tribesmen also joined the movement, although their support proved inconsistent.
- **Base of Operations:** A base was established in the Peshawar valley region, initially securing footholds in areas like Panjtar and Sittana.
- **Funding and Logistics:** The movement relied on voluntary contributions (_zakat_ and donations) collected through a network of supporters across India. Logistics, including arms procurement and supply lines across hostile territory, were a constant challenge.
- **Proclaiming Imamate:** Syed Ahmad formally assumed the title of Imam and required oaths of allegiance (_bay'ah_), attempting to establish political and religious authority over the areas under his influence.
- **Initial Military Engagements:** The Mujahideen engaged in several battles against Sikh forces and sometimes against local tribal groups who opposed them or allied with the Sikhs.
    - **Battle of Akora Khattak (1826):** An early, indecisive clash shortly after arriving in the Frontier.
    - **Battle of Hazro (1827):** A victory that boosted morale.
    - **Attempt on Peshawar:** The Mujahideen briefly occupied Peshawar in 1830 but were unable to hold it due to internal divisions and lack of sustained local support. Syed Ahmad's attempts to impose strict Sharia law (including on issues like bride price) alienated some local tribal leaders.

**Challenges Faced by the Movement:**

- **Internal Divisions:** Maintaining unity among diverse followers (Hindustanis vs. Pashtuns) and different Pashtun tribes proved difficult. Cultural differences and competing local interests often hampered cooperation.  
    
- **Local Opposition:** Not all Pashtun tribes supported the movement. Some were wary of Syed Ahmad's authority, resented his attempts to reform their customs, or were bribed/coerced by the Sikhs. Clashes occurred between the Mujahideen and certain tribes.
- **Sikh Military Superiority:** Ranjit Singh's army was well-trained (partly by European officers), disciplined, and better equipped than the Mujahideen forces, particularly in artillery.
- **Logistical Difficulties:** Maintaining supply lines from India across hundreds of miles of difficult and often hostile territory was a major constraint.
- **British Neutrality/Indirect Opposition:** While not directly intervening initially, the British authorities monitored the movement closely and were wary of its potential to destabilize the region or eventually turn against them. They did little to impede Sikh actions against the Mujahideen.

**The Battle of Balakot (1831):**

- **Background:** Facing increasing difficulties and betrayals in the Peshawar valley, Syed Ahmad and his core group of followers relocated northeast towards the Kaghan Valley, aiming to regroup.
- **The Battle:** Sikh forces under Sher Singh pursued them and cornered the significantly outnumbered Mujahideen at Balakot in May 1831.  
    
- **Outcome:** The battle resulted in a decisive defeat for the Mujahideen. Syed Ahmad Barelvi, Shah Ismail Shaheed, and many key leaders and followers were killed.

**Legacy and Aftermath:**

- **End of the Main Phase:** The Battle of Balakot effectively ended the Jihad Movement as a major military threat led by its original charismatic figures.
- **Continuation in Fragments:** Remnants of the Mujahideen continued sporadic resistance from the Frontier for several decades, sometimes participating in tribal uprisings against the Sikhs and later against the British (e.g., the Ambela Campaign of 1863). The 'Mujahideen Colony' at Sittana remained a center of anti-British sentiment for some time.
- **Inspiration for Future Movements:** Despite its military failure, the Jihad Movement served as a powerful symbol of armed resistance against non-Muslim rule. It inspired later generations of Muslims in the subcontinent who sought political independence or the establishment of an Islamic order. Its narrative of sacrifice and martyrdom became influential.
- **Influence on Religious Thought:** The movement's emphasis on puritanical reform and Jihad continued to influence certain strands of Islamic thought in South Asia, contributing to the ideologies of various groups long after its military demise.
- **Historical Debate:** The movement remains a subject of historical debate regarding its motives, impact, and the appropriateness of its methods. It is viewed variously as a heroic struggle for faith and freedom, a divisive and ultimately unsuccessful venture, or an early precursor to later Islamist movements.

**Conclusion:** The Jihad Movement led by Syed Ahmad Barelvi was a significant attempt to translate Islamic revivalist ideals into political and military action in early 19th century India. While demonstrating considerable zeal and attracting dedicated followers (Mujahideen), it faced insurmountable challenges including internal divisions, logistical constraints, and the military strength of the Sikh Empire. Its decisive defeat at Balakot marked the end of its main phase, but its legacy as a symbol of religious purification and armed struggle endured, profoundly influencing subsequent Islamic discourse and movements in the subcontinent.

### **4. Haji Shariatullah and the Faraizi Movement**

**Introduction:** Haji Shariatullah (1781-1840) was a prominent Islamic reformer in Bengal (Eastern India) during the early 19th century. He founded the Faraizi Movement, which aimed to purify the religious practices of Bengali Muslims by purging un-Islamic customs and focusing strictly on the obligatory duties (_fara'id_) of Islam. Operating primarily among the rural peasantry, the movement also developed socio-economic and political dimensions, challenging the exploitation faced by Muslim cultivators under Hindu landlords (_zamindars_) and British indigo planters.  

**Historical Context: Early 19th Century Bengal**

- **British Rule:** Bengal had been under the effective control of the British East India Company since the mid-18th century (Battle of Plassey, 1757). The Permanent Settlement of 1793 had established a new land revenue system that often empowered Hindu zamindars over predominantly Muslim peasant cultivators (_ryots_).  
    
- **Socio-Economic Exploitation:** Muslim peasants in rural East Bengal faced severe economic hardship. They were often subjected to exorbitant rents and illegal cesses (_abwabs_) imposed by zamindars. Additionally, the forced cultivation of indigo by British planters under exploitative terms added to their misery. Many peasants were trapped in debt and poverty.  
    
- **Religious Syncretism and Ignorance:** Due to centuries of living alongside a majority Hindu population and relative isolation from major centers of Islamic learning, many rural Bengali Muslims practiced a syncretic form of Islam, incorporating numerous local customs and rituals deemed un-Islamic by reformers.
    
    - Practices like reverence for local deities or spirits, elaborate ceremonies influenced by Hindu customs (e.g., during marriage or harvest), belief in superstitions, and deviations in prayer rituals were common.
    - There was widespread ignorance regarding the fundamental tenets and obligatory duties of Islam.
    
     
    
- **Haji Shariatullah's Background:** Shariatullah belonged to a family of modest means in Faridpur district. He spent nearly twenty years (c. 1799-1818) in Mecca and Medina, studying Islamic theology and law. During his time in Arabia, he was likely influenced by the Wahhabi movement's emphasis on puritanical reform and strict adherence to the Quran and Sunnah, although the Faraizi movement retained distinct characteristics.

**The Faraizi Movement: Teachings and Principles**

Returning to Bengal around 1818, Haji Shariatullah was dismayed by the religious practices and socio-economic conditions of his fellow Muslims and launched his reform movement.  

- **Focus on _Fara'id_ (Obligatory Duties):** The movement derived its name "Faraizi" from _farḍ_ (plural _fara'id_), meaning obligatory duty in Islam. Shariatullah insisted that Muslims must strictly adhere to the five fundamental pillars:
    1. _Shahada_ (Declaration of Faith)  
        
    2. _Salat_ (Five Daily Prayers)
    3. _Zakat_ (Charity)
    4. _Sawm_ (Fasting during Ramadan)
    5. _Hajj_ (Pilgrimage to Mecca, if able)  
        
- **Rejection of _Bid'ah_ and _Shirk_:** He vehemently condemned all customs, rituals, and beliefs that he considered non-Islamic innovations (_bid'ah_) or polytheistic associations (_shirk_). This included:
    - Participating in Hindu festivals or ceremonies.
    - Excessive mourning ceremonies (_matam_ - though this was more Shia, elements could be present).
    - Elaborate life-cycle rituals beyond simple Islamic requirements.
    - Practices associated with popular Sufism that deviated from Sharia, like elaborate _urs_ celebrations at shrines or seeking intercession directly from deceased saints.
- **Emphasis on _Tawhid_:** Like other revivalists, he stressed the absolute oneness of God and directed worship solely towards Allah.
- **Declaration of British India as _Dar-ul-Harb_:** A significant and controversial aspect of his teaching was the declaration that Bengal under British rule was _Dar-ul-Harb_ (Abode of War), not _Dar-ul-Islam_ (Abode of Islam). This had practical implications: he argued that congregational prayers like the Friday _Jumu'ah_ prayer and the Eid prayers were not obligatory (or even permissible according to some interpretations) in a land ruled by non-Muslims where Islamic law was not supreme. This was a form of passive resistance and non-cooperation with the existing political order.
- **Socio-Economic Justice:** Shariatullah linked religious reform with social upliftment. He preached against the illegal cesses imposed by Hindu zamindars and urged peasants not to pay them. He advocated for the rights of Muslim cultivators and fostered a sense of unity and self-reliance among them.  
    

**Organization and Activities:**

- **Preaching and Mobilization:** Haji Shariatullah travelled through the districts of East Bengal (Dhaka, Faridpur, Barisal, Mymensingh), preaching his message directly to the rural masses – weavers, peasants, oil-grinders.
- **Simple Structure:** The movement initially had a simple structure centered around Shariatullah's personal authority and network of deputies (_khalifas_).
- **Focus on Peasants:** Its primary base of support was among the oppressed Muslim peasantry and artisans.
- **Resistance to Un-Islamic Taxes:** The refusal to pay non-Islamic cesses levied by zamindars often brought the Faraizis into conflict with the landlords and, indirectly, with the British authorities who upheld the zamindari system.  
    

**Succession and Evolution under Dudu Miyan:**

- **Dudu Miyan (Mohsinuddin Ahmad):** After Haji Shariatullah's death in 1840, the leadership passed to his son, Mohsinuddin Ahmad, popularly known as Dudu Miyan (1819-1862).
- **Increased Militancy and Organization:** Dudu Miyan was a more pragmatic and militant leader. He organized the Faraizis more systematically, dividing Bengal into circles (_halqas_) supervised by _khalifas_. He established Faraizi courts to settle disputes among followers according to their interpretation of Islamic law, creating a parallel system of administration.
- **Focus on Peasant Rights:** Under Dudu Miyan, the movement became more overtly focused on agrarian issues and peasant resistance. He led campaigns urging peasants not to pay rent to zamindars and directly confronted landlords and indigo planters. His slogan was "Land belongs to God," implying peasants who tilled it had the primary right.
- **Conflict with Authorities:** Dudu Miyan's activities led to numerous clashes with zamindars and planters, resulting in legal cases and his occasional imprisonment by British authorities. The movement took on the character of an organized peasant uprising with strong religious underpinnings.  
    

**Impact and Legacy:**

- **Religious Reform:** The Faraizi Movement significantly impacted the religious practices of Muslims in East Bengal, purging many syncretic elements and promoting greater adherence to core Islamic tenets. It fostered a distinct religious identity among rural Muslims.  
    
- **Social Consciousness:** It raised awareness among Muslim peasants about their socio-economic rights and encouraged them to resist exploitation. It fostered a sense of communal unity and solidarity.
- **Contribution to Bengali Muslim Identity:** The movement played a role in shaping the identity and political consciousness of Bengali Muslims, highlighting their grievances and distinguishing their religious practice from local non-Islamic influences.
- **Limitations and Decline:** While powerful in certain districts, the movement's influence was largely confined to East Bengal. After Dudu Miyan's death in 1862, the movement lost its central leadership and confrontational edge, gradually declining into a more quietist religious sect, although its emphasis on _fara'id_ continued.  
    
- **Historical Significance:** The Faraizi Movement is recognized as one of the earliest and most significant religio-political mass movements in British India, combining religious purification with socio-economic protest against colonial structures and local exploitation.  
    

**Conclusion:** Haji Shariatullah and the Faraizi Movement represent a crucial chapter in the history of Islam in Bengal. By insisting on adherence to the fundamental duties (_fara'id_) of Islam and rejecting syncretic practices, Shariatullah initiated a powerful reform movement. Under his leadership and that of his son Dudu Miyan, the movement evolved to encompass socio-economic resistance against exploitation by landlords and planters, mobilizing the rural Muslim peasantry and leaving a lasting legacy on the religious and social landscape of the region.
