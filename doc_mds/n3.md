### **The War of Independence 1857–58**

**1. Immediate and Underlying Causes of the War**

The uprising of 1857 was not a sudden event but the culmination of accumulated grievances against British rule under the East India Company (EIC). These causes can be categorized as:  

- **Political Causes:**
    
    - **Doctrine of Lapse:** Lord Dalhousie's policy of annexing states where rulers died without a natural heir (e.g., Satara, Nagpur, Jhansi) caused widespread resentment among Indian rulers and fear for their own futures. The annexation of Awadh (Oudh) in 1856 on grounds of mismanagement, despite its loyalty, was particularly unpopular.  
        
    - **Subsidiary Alliance System:** Introduced by Lord Wellesley, this system forced Indian rulers to accept British troops (paying for their maintenance), dismiss non-British European advisors, and surrender control of foreign affairs, effectively ending their sovereignty.  
        
    - **Disrespect to the Mughal Emperor:** The symbolic authority of the Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was systematically undermined. His title was diminished, his potential successors were denied imperial status, and there were plans to move the imperial family out of the Red Fort after his death. This offended many Muslims who still held the Emperor in high regard.
    - **Loss of Power for Nobility:** Annexations and administrative changes dispossessed many traditional aristocrats, landowners (_taluqdars_ in Awadh), and their dependents, creating a disgruntled class.  
        
- **Economic Causes:**
    
    - **Heavy Taxation:** High land revenue demands under various settlements (Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, Mahalwari) impoverished peasants, leading to indebtedness and loss of land.
    - **Destruction of Traditional Industries:** British policies favored the import of cheap, machine-made goods from Britain, devastating Indian handicraft industries, especially textiles (like Dhaka muslin). This led to widespread unemployment among artisans.
    - **Exploitative Economic Policies:** India was treated as a source of raw materials and a market for British goods, draining wealth from the subcontinent.  
        
    - **Confiscation of Estates:** Land revenue policies and resumption of rent-free land grants (_inams_) alienated many landowners.
- **Social and Religious Causes:**
    
    - **Racial Discrimination:** The British maintained a sense of racial superiority, treating Indians with contempt and arrogance in social interactions and administration.  
        
    - **Interference in Customs:** Reforms like the abolition of _Sati_ (widow immolation) and the Widow Remarriage Act, while progressive, were seen by orthodox sections as interference in religious and social customs.  
        
    - **Activities of Christian Missionaries:** Missionary activities, often perceived to have official backing, created fears among both Hindus and Muslims that the British aimed to convert the population to Christianity. The introduction of Western education was also viewed with suspicion by some.  
        
    - **Religious Disabilities Act (1850):** This act modified Hindu custom by allowing converts from Hinduism to inherit ancestral property, further fueling fears of conversion attempts.  
        
    - **Fear of Westernization:** Rapid introduction of railways, telegraph, and Western education seemed to threaten traditional ways of life.  
        
- **Military Causes:**
    
    - **Discrimination against Sepoys:** Indian soldiers (_sepoys_) faced discrimination in pay, promotion, and treatment compared to British soldiers. They were often treated harshly by their European officers.  
        
    - **General Service Enlistment Act (1856):** This act required new recruits to serve overseas if needed. This violated the beliefs of high-caste Hindu sepoys, for whom crossing the sea (_kala pani_) meant loss of caste.  
        
    - **Withdrawal of Allowances:** Allowances (_bhatta_) previously paid for service in newly annexed territories (like Sindh and Punjab) were withdrawn, causing resentment.
    - **Disproportionate Numbers:** The ratio of Indian sepoys to British soldiers had increased significantly, giving the sepoys a sense of their own strength.
- **Immediate Cause: The Greased Cartridges:**
    
    - The trigger was the introduction of the new Enfield rifle. Its cartridges were rumoured to be greased with pig and cow fat. To load the rifle, sepoys had to bite off the end of the cartridge. This was offensive to both Muslims (pigs being forbidden) and Hindus (cows being sacred). Despite British attempts to rectify the situation, the damage was done. Sepoys saw it as a deliberate attempt to defile their religion and caste, igniting the already simmering discontent into open revolt starting in Meerut in May 1857.  
        

**2. The Attitude of Bahadur Shah Zafar**

- **Reluctant Leader:** Bahadur Shah Zafar, the aged Mughal Emperor living in Delhi on a British pension, was initially hesitant and surprised when the mutinous sepoys from Meerut arrived in Delhi, killed British officials, and proclaimed him their leader. He had little real power and lacked military or administrative experience.  
    
- **Symbolic Figurehead:** Despite his reluctance, his name provided a traditional symbol of authority and a rallying point for diverse rebel forces. His acceptance, however nominal, gave the uprising a semblance of legitimacy and united various groups under the banner of restoring Mughal rule.
- **Proclamations:** Under pressure from the rebels, proclamations were issued in his name calling for Indians to unite and expel the British.
- **Trial and Exile:** After the British recaptured Delhi in September 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was captured, tried for treason, and exiled to Rangoon, Burma, where he died in 1862. His exile marked the definitive end of the Mughal dynasty.

**3. The Course of the War (with reference to regions now in Pakistan)**

The War spread rapidly from Meerut across North and Central India. Major centers of revolt included Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Jhansi, Bareilly, and Arrah.  

- **Key Events Elsewhere:** Capture of Delhi by rebels, siege of Lucknow Residency, Kanpur massacre, heroic resistance by figures like Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, Nana Sahib, Tantia Tope, Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah, Kunwar Singh.  
    
- **Role of Regions Now in Pakistan:**
    - **Punjab:** Crucially, Punjab remained largely loyal to the British and did _not_ join the revolt on a large scale. This was vital for the British success.
        - **Reasons for Loyalty:** Punjab had been annexed relatively recently (1849) after the Anglo-Sikh wars. Many Sikhs and Punjabi Muslims felt little affinity with the Hindustani sepoys of the Bengal Army who formed the core of the rebellion and who had helped the British conquer Punjab. The memory of Mughal persecution also lingered among some Sikhs. British administration under figures like John Lawrence had been relatively efficient, and land settlements were sometimes more favourable than elsewhere. The Punjabi elite (including Sikh princes and Muslim feudatories) largely sided with the British.  
            
        - **British Actions:** The British acted swiftly in Punjab to disarm potentially disloyal Bengal Army regiments stationed there. They raised new regiments of loyal Punjabi Sikhs, Muslims, and Pathans who played a critical role in suppressing the revolt, particularly during the siege and recapture of Delhi.
        - **Limited Uprisings:** There were some isolated mutinies and local disturbances (e.g., Sialkot, Murree hills), but these were quickly suppressed.
    - **Sindh:** Sindh, annexed in 1843, also remained relatively quiet. British control under figures like Bartle Frere was firm. While there might have been sympathy for the rebels, there was no major uprising. Karachi, the main port, remained secure.
    - **North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) / Tribal Areas:** The frontier region also did not see widespread revolt comparable to that in the Gangetic plains. British control established after the annexation of Punjab was consolidating. Some tribal groups remained hostile to the British, but others were recruited into British forces (like the Punjab Irregular Force). The focus of British military strength here was often directed towards maintaining frontier security rather than dealing with internal revolt. Peshawar remained under firm British control.  
        

In essence, the areas now constituting Pakistan largely served as a base of support and recruitment for the British, providing the manpower (especially from Punjab) needed to crush the rebellion in North India. The loyalty of Punjab, in particular, was a decisive factor.

**4. Reasons for Failure**

The War of Independence failed due to several factors:

- **Lack of Unity and Coordination:** The revolt lacked central leadership and coordination. Different groups and leaders fought for different reasons (restoration of Mughal rule, local grievances, religious motives) and often failed to cooperate effectively.  
    
- **Limited Territorial Spread:** The uprising was mainly confined to North and Central India. Large parts of the country, including the South, Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh, remained largely unaffected or actively supported the British.
- **Lack of Support from All Sections:** Not all classes and groups joined. Many Indian rulers (e.g., Scindia, Holkar, Nizam of Hyderabad, Sikh princes), educated elites, and merchants sided with the British or remained neutral, fearing instability.  
    
- **Weak Leadership:** While leaders like Rani Lakshmibai and Tantia Tope were brave, they were no match for experienced British commanders (like Havelock, Outram, Campbell, Nicholson, Lawrence brothers) in terms of overall strategy and organization. Bahadur Shah Zafar was too old and lacked the capacity to lead effectively.  
    
- **Superior British Resources:** The British had superior weaponry, better organization, control of the seas (allowing reinforcements), and access to the newly introduced telegraph system, which enabled rapid communication and coordination of troop movements.
- **Loyalty of Punjabi and Gurkha Troops:** The decisive role played by Sikh, Punjabi Muslim, Pathan, and Gurkha troops recruited by the British was crucial in suppressing the rebellion.  
    

**5. Short-Term Impact of the War on Muslims in the Subcontinent**

Muslims faced particularly harsh consequences in the immediate aftermath:  

- **British Blame:** The British tended to blame Muslims disproportionately for the uprising, largely because Bahadur Shah Zafar, a Muslim, was the nominal head, and because many _ulema_ (religious scholars) had issued _fatwas_ supporting the jihad against the British.
- **Loss of Political Power:** The final end of the Mughal dynasty symbolized the complete loss of Muslim political authority at the highest level.
- **Discrimination and Repression:** Muslims faced severe repression, execution, confiscation of property (especially in areas like Delhi and UP), and discrimination in government employment, particularly in the army. Their representation in administration declined sharply.
- **Educational and Economic Backwardness:** Suspicion and discrimination, combined with a reluctance among some Muslims to embrace Western education initially, contributed to their lagging behind Hindus in education and economic opportunities in the subsequent decades.
- **Psychological Impact:** The failure of the revolt and the subsequent repression led to a period of demoralization and introspection within the Muslim community.

**6. British Reaction and Reforms**

The War of 1857 was a major shock to the British and led to significant changes in policy and administration:  

- **Brutal Suppression:** The British suppressed the revolt with ruthless severity, involving widespread killings, destruction of property, and summary executions.  
    
- **End of Company Rule:** The most significant constitutional change was the **Government of India Act 1858**, which abolished the East India Company and transferred the governance of India directly to the British Crown. Control was vested in a Secretary of State for India, advised by a Council of India, operating from London. The Governor-General in India was given the additional title of Viceroy, representing the Crown.  
    
- **Queen Victoria's Proclamation (November 1, 1858):** Issued by the Queen (read out by Viceroy Lord Canning), this proclamation aimed to pacify India. It promised:
    
    - Respect for the rights, dignity, and honour of Indian princes (ending the Doctrine of Lapse).
    - Non-interference in Indian religious beliefs and customs.
    - Equal treatment and opportunity for Indians in government service (though this was often ignored in practice).
    - Amnesty to rebels who had not directly killed British subjects.  
        
    
     
    
- **Army Reorganization:** The proportion of British soldiers in the Indian army was significantly increased (often aimed at a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio). Key installations like artillery were placed exclusively in British hands. Recruitment policies were changed to favour 'martial races' (like Sikhs, Gurkhas, Punjabi Muslims, Pathans who had remained loyal) over groups from regions that had revolted (like Awadh). The objective was 'divide and rule' within the army.  
    
- **Administrative Changes:** Centralized control was strengthened. Efforts were made to associate Indians (particularly loyalist aristocrats and landowners) more closely with the administration through councils, albeit in advisory roles initially (e.g., Indian Councils Act 1861). Policies aimed at strengthening the position of landlords and princes as bulwarks against future unrest.
- **Educational Policy:** While initially blaming Muslims and perhaps favouring Hindus, the British eventually recognized the need to engage with Muslim elites. Figures like Sir Syed Ahmed Khan later advocated for Western education among Muslims to enable them to participate in the new administrative setup, leading to movements like the Aligarh Movement, which received cautious British support over time.  
    
- **Shift in Attitude:** While promising equality, the war also deepened racial distrust and distance between the British rulers and the Indian population. The era of relative integration seen in the early EIC period gave way to a more formal, segregated, and racially conscious imperial structure.
