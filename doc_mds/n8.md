**Comprehensive Notes: The Pakistan Movement (1927-1939) - Consolidation and Growing Divergence**

**Introduction**

The period from 1927 to 1939 was pivotal for the Pakistan Movement. While the previous decades saw the emergence of Muslim political consciousness and organization, this era witnessed the failure of attempts at Hindu-Muslim political unity within a single Indian framework, the clearer articulation of Muslim demands, the formulation of the ideological basis for separatism, and the consolidation of the Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The experiences during this time, particularly the failure of constitutional negotiations to safeguard perceived Muslim interests and the experience of Congress rule, significantly propelled the movement towards the eventual demand for a separate state. Assessing the "success" of the movement in this period means evaluating how effectively it laid the groundwork, strengthened its political base, defined its goals, and created the conditions for the Lahore Resolution of 1940.

**1. The Simon Commission (1927–1930)**

- **Context:** The Government of India Act 1919 had provided for a review of constitutional progress after ten years. The British Conservative government appointed the commission two years early in 1927, under Sir John Simon.
    
- **Composition:** Consisted solely of seven British Members of Parliament. Critically, it included **no Indian members**.
    
- **Purpose:** To investigate the working of the 1919 Act and recommend further constitutional reforms for India.
    
- **Indian Reaction (Boycott):** The exclusion of Indians caused outrage across the political spectrum. The Indian National Congress, a significant section of the Muslim League (led by Jinnah), and other nationalist groups decided to boycott the Commission under the slogan "Simon Go Back." Massive protests greeted the Commission wherever it went.
    
- **Internal Division in Muslim League:** The decision to boycott caused a split in the Muslim League. One faction, led by Jinnah, supported the boycott. Another faction, led by Sir Muhammad Shafi, decided to cooperate with the Commission, hoping to secure safeguards for Muslims directly from the British.
    
- **Significance for Pakistan Movement:**
    
    - **Spurred Indian Constitutional Efforts:** The boycott forced Indian political parties to formulate their own constitutional proposals, leading directly to the Nehru Report.
        
    - **Highlighted League Divisions:** Exposed temporary divisions within the League regarding strategy (cooperation vs. boycott).
        
    - **Reinforced Need for Unity (temporarily):** The insult of exclusion pushed Jinnah towards seeking common ground with Congress initially (leading to participation in the All-Parties Conference that produced the Nehru Report).
        

**2. The Nehru Report (1928)**

- **Context:** A response to the challenge posed by the British (specifically Lord Birkenhead, Secretary of State for India) for Indians to produce their own agreed-upon constitution, and a direct consequence of the Simon Commission boycott. An All-Parties Conference appointed a committee chaired by Motilal Nehru (with Jawaharlal Nehru as secretary) to draft a constitution.
    
- **Key Proposals:**
    
    - **Dominion Status:** Recommended Dominion Status for India (like Canada or Australia) as the immediate goal, not full independence.
        
    - **Unitary Structure (with some Provincial Powers):** Proposed a strong central government with residuary powers vested in it, differing from the Muslim League's preference for a looser federation with strong provincial autonomy.
        
    - **Rejection of Separate Electorates:** Advocated for joint electorates for all communities, with reservation of seats for Muslims only in provinces where they were a minority, and not in Punjab and Bengal where they had a slight majority. Reservation was proposed only for ten years.
        
    - **Rejection of One-Third Central Representation:** Did not concede the Muslim demand for one-third representation in the Central Legislature.
        
    - **Sindh Separation & NWFP Reforms:** Agreed to separate Sindh from Bombay and grant reforms in NWFP, but made these conditional on India achieving Dominion Status.
        
- **Muslim Reaction:** The report was rejected by most Muslim leaders, including Jinnah and the Aga Khan. Key objections were:
    
    - The rejection of separate electorates, which were seen as essential for safeguarding Muslim representation.
        
    - The denial of one-third representation at the Centre.
        
    - The allocation of residuary powers to the Centre, fearing Hindu dominance.
        
    - The lack of guaranteed proportional representation in Punjab and Bengal.
        
- **Significance for Pakistan Movement:**
    
    - **Major Setback for Unity:** The Nehru Report marked a critical breakdown in Hindu-Muslim political negotiations. It shattered the hope generated by the Delhi Proposals (1927) where Jinnah had offered to give up separate electorates under certain conditions.
        
    - **Alienation of Jinnah:** Jinnah, who had strived for Hindu-Muslim unity, felt deeply disappointed and described this as the "parting of the ways."
        
    - **Consolidation of Muslim Demands:** The rejection prompted Jinnah and the Muslim League to clearly formulate their minimum demands for any future constitutional settlement, leading directly to Jinnah's 14 Points.
        

**3. Jinnah’s 14 Points (1929)**

- **Context:** Directly formulated in response to the rejection of Muslim demands in the Nehru Report. Presented by Muhammad Ali Jinnah in March 1929 as the minimum conditions for Muslims to accept any future constitution for India.
    
- **Focus Area: Why did Jinnah produce his 14 Points?**
    
    - **Rejection of Nehru Report:** The primary reason was the Nehru Report's dismissal of key Muslim safeguards previously discussed (like the Delhi Proposals) and its proposal for a constitutional framework perceived as favouring the Hindu majority (joint electorates without guaranteed adequate representation, strong centre).
        
    - **Need for Clarity:** Jinnah felt the need to clearly and comprehensively articulate the fundamental demands of the Muslim community to serve as a non-negotiable basis for future constitutional discussions with both the British and Congress.
        
    - **Unifying Muslim Opinion:** Following the split over the Simon Commission and varying reactions to the Nehru Report, the 14 Points aimed to consolidate diverse Muslim political opinions around a common set of demands, strengthening the League's position.
        
    - **Counter-Proposal:** Served as a direct counter-proposal to the Nehru Report, outlining the Muslim vision for India's future political structure.
        
- **Key Points (Summary):**
    
    1. **Federal Constitution:** With residuary powers vested in the provinces.
        
    2. **Provincial Autonomy:** Uniform measure of autonomy for all provinces.
        
    3. **Effective Minority Representation:** Legislatures constituted to ensure adequate representation of minorities in every province without reducing majorities to minorities/equalities.
        
    4. **One-Third Muslim Representation:** In the Central Legislature.
        
    5. **Separate Electorates:** Continuation of separate electorates, with the option for any community to switch to joint electorates if desired.
        
    6. **Territorial Readjustments:** No changes to boundaries of Punjab, Bengal, and NWFP that would affect the Muslim majority.
        
    7. **Religious Freedom:** Full liberty of belief, worship, observance, propaganda, association, and education.
        
    8. **Communal Veto:** No bill or resolution to be passed if three-fourths of the members of any community in that body oppose it as injurious to their interests.
        
    9. **Separation of Sindh:** From Bombay Presidency.
        
    10. **Reforms in NWFP and Balochistan:** Introduction on the same footing as other provinces.
        
    11. **Adequate Share in Services:** For Muslims in state services and local self-governing bodies.
        
    12. **Protection of Culture:** Safeguards for Muslim religion, culture, and personal law.
        
    13. **Cabinet Representation:** Inclusion of at least one-third Muslim ministers in central and provincial cabinets.
        
    14. **Constitutional Amendments:** Concurrence of federating states required for central legislature to amend the constitution.
        
- **Significance:**
    
    - **Core Muslim Demands:** Became the foundation of Muslim political demands for the next decade.
        
    - **Basis for Negotiation:** Served as the Muslim League's benchmark in subsequent negotiations like the Round Table Conferences.
        
    - **Hardening of Stance:** Indicated a hardening of the Muslim political stance after the failure of compromise attempts.
        

**4. Allama Iqbal’s Allahabad Address (1930)**

- **Context:** Delivered by Sir Muhammad Iqbal (philosopher-poet) as the presidential address at the annual session of the All-India Muslim League in Allahabad, December 1930.
    
- **Key Idea:** Iqbal articulated a clear vision for a consolidated Muslim political entity in northwestern India. He stated: "I would like to see the Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind and Baluchistan amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the British Empire, or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated North-West Indian Muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of North-West India."
    
- **Nature of the Demand:** It was primarily a call for the consolidation of Muslim-majority areas in the northwest into a distinct political unit within or without the British Empire. It was more about achieving cultural and political self-determination for the Muslim community in its majority regions than a fully formed demand for a completely independent sovereign state separate from the rest of India at that point.
    
- **Significance:**
    
    - **Ideological Foundation:** Provided a powerful intellectual and philosophical justification for Muslim separatism, moving beyond demands for safeguards towards the idea of a distinct homeland.
        
    - **Inspiration for Pakistan:** Although not using the name "Pakistan" and differing in scope from the later demand, Iqbal's address is considered a landmark moment that inspired future proponents of Pakistan, including Jinnah and Rahmat Ali.
        
    - **Shift in Discourse:** Marked a significant shift in the political discourse, introducing the concept of territorial consolidation based on religious identity.
        

**5. The Round Table Conferences (RTCs) (1930–32)**

- **Context:** Held in London by the British government to discuss future constitutional reforms for India, following the Simon Commission report and widespread Indian demands. Three sessions were held.
    
- **Participants:** Included representatives from British political parties, Indian princely states, and various Indian political organizations and communities (including Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Depressed Classes, etc.).
    
    - **First RTC (Nov 1930 - Jan 1931):** Boycotted by Congress. Muslim League delegation led by Aga Khan, Jinnah also attended. Discussed federalism and minority safeguards but made little concrete progress without Congress.
        
    - **Second RTC (Sept 1931 - Dec 1931):** Attended by Gandhi as the sole representative of Congress following the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. Major disagreements arose over the federal structure and, crucially, minority representation (separate electorates). Gandhi opposed separate electorates for minorities, especially the Depressed Classes. Jinnah strongly advocated for Muslim safeguards. The conference ended in deadlock on the communal issue.
        
    - **Third RTC (Nov 1932 - Dec 1932):** Smaller conference, boycotted by Congress again. Labour Party also did not attend. Final discussions took place, but major decisions were left to the British government.
        
- **Focus Area: How successful were the three Round Table Conferences?**
    
    - **Limited Success:**
        
        - **Agreement on Federalism:** Established consensus on the principle of an All-India Federation comprising British India and Princely States (though this never materialized).
            
        - **Provincial Autonomy:** Agreement was reached on granting substantial autonomy to the provinces.
            
        - **Platform for Discussion:** Provided a platform for various Indian interests to present their views directly to the British government.
            
    - **Major Failures:**
        
        - **Failure to Bridge Congress-League Divide:** Could not reconcile the fundamental differences between Congress and the Muslim League, particularly over representation and safeguards.
            
        - **Communal Deadlock:** Failed to find an agreed solution to the communal representation issue, forcing the British to impose the Communal Award.
            
        - **Congress Non-Participation:** The absence or limited participation of Congress, the largest political party, undermined the legitimacy and effectiveness of the conferences.
            
        - **Inability to Produce Agreed Constitution:** Failed to produce a constitution agreed upon by major Indian parties.
            
- **Overall Assessment:** The RTCs were largely unsuccessful in achieving their primary goal of forging a consensus among Indian parties on a future constitution. They highlighted the deep communal divisions and differing political aspirations, particularly between Congress and the Muslim League. However, they did lay the groundwork for the Government of India Act, 1935, by solidifying agreement on provincial autonomy and the (unfulfilled) idea of federation.
    

**6. The Communal Award (1932)**

- **Context:** Announced by British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in August 1932, following the failure of Indian delegates to agree on the minorities issue at the Second RTC.
    
- **Provisions:**
    
    - **Maintained Separate Electorates:** Continued the system of separate electorates for Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, and Europeans, as established by previous reforms.
        
    - **Allocated Seats:** Specified the number of seats reserved for each minority community in the provincial legislatures.
        
    - **Separate Electorates for Depressed Classes:** Controversially, it granted separate electorates (and reserved seats) to the Depressed Classes (untouchables) within the Hindu community.
        
- **Reactions:**
    
    - **Muslim League:** Generally accepted the Award, as it retained separate electorates, a key demand.
        
    - **Congress:** Opposed the Award, particularly the provision for the Depressed Classes, seeing it as an attempt to divide the Hindu community.
        
    - **Gandhi:** Undertook a "fast unto death" in protest against separate electorates for the Depressed Classes. This led to the **Poona Pact (1932)** between Gandhi and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (leader of the Depressed Classes), where separate electorates for them were abandoned in favour of a larger number of reserved seats filled by joint electorates.
        
- **Significance:**
    
    - **Formalized Communal Representation:** Further entrenched communal representation in the Indian political structure.
        
    - **Accepted by Muslims:** Provided the framework for Muslim representation under the upcoming Government of India Act 1935.
        
    - **Highlighted Hindu Divisions:** Exposed internal divisions within the Hindu community, although the Poona Pact resolved the immediate crisis over the Depressed Classes' representation.
        

**7. Rahmat Ali and the Pakistan National Movement (1933)**

- **Context:** Chaudhry Rahmat Ali was a Muslim nationalist student studying at Cambridge University.
    
- **The Pamphlet "Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?":** In January 1933, Rahmat Ali and his associates published this pamphlet.
    
- **Coining the Term "Pakistan":** This pamphlet is famous for coining the name "Pakistan." Rahmat Ali proposed it as an acronym for the five northern units of India: **P**unjab, **A**fghania (North-West Frontier Province), **K**ashmir, **S**indh, and Baluchis**tan**. It also translates to "Land of the Pure" in Persian and Urdu.
    
- **The Demand:** Rahmat Ali advocated for a fully independent sovereign state ("Pakistan") comprising these northwestern Muslim-majority areas, completely separate from the rest of India. His vision was more radical and immediate than Iqbal's 1930 proposal.
    
- **Initial Reception:** At the time, his idea was largely dismissed by mainstream Muslim League leaders (including Jinnah) as impractical and a "student's dream." They were still focused on negotiating safeguards within a federal India.
    
- **Significance:**
    
    - **Named the Goal:** Provided a powerful and evocative name for the potential future Muslim state, which captured the imagination later.
        
    - **Conceptualized Separation:** Clearly articulated the demand for complete political separation, influencing the trajectory of the movement.
        
    - **Grassroots Appeal:** Although initially dismissed by leaders, the idea and the name gradually gained currency among Muslim students and the public.
        

**8. The Government of India Act, 1935**

- **Context:** The culmination of the process started by the Simon Commission and the Round Table Conferences. It was the longest piece of legislation passed by the British Parliament at that time.
    
- **Key Provisions:**
    
    - **All-India Federation:** Proposed a federation comprising Governors' Provinces, Chief Commissioners' Provinces, and Princely States that chose to accede. However, the federal part **never came into operation** as the required number of princely states refused to join, fearing loss of sovereignty.
        
    - **Provincial Autonomy:** This part was implemented. It abolished dyarchy in the provinces and introduced responsible government. Provincial governments were formed by ministers from elected legislatures, responsible to those legislatures for most matters. Governors retained significant discretionary 'reserve powers' and 'special responsibilities' (e.g., safeguarding minorities, peace and tranquility).
        
    - **Bicameral Legislature (Centre):** Provided for a bicameral federal legislature (Council of State and Federal Assembly), but this also never materialized due to the failure of federation. The existing central legislature continued.
        
    - **Extension of Franchise:** Increased the electorate significantly (from approx. 7 million to 35 million, about one-sixth of the adult population), but still based on property and educational qualifications.
        
    - **Separate Electorates Continued:** Retained separate electorates and weightage for minorities as allocated by the Communal Award (modified by the Poona Pact for Depressed Classes).
        
    - **Separation of Burma:** Burma was separated from British India. Sindh was separated from Bombay, and Orissa was created as a separate province.
        
- **Focus Area: How important was the Government of India Act, 1935?**
    
    - **Crucial Step towards Self-Government:** Introduced provincial autonomy, giving Indians significant experience in running provincial administrations for the first time. This was a major constitutional advance.
        
    - **Framework for 1937 Elections:** Provided the constitutional basis for the landmark 1937 provincial elections.
        
    - **Testing Ground:** The working of provincial autonomy under the Act directly led to the Congress Rule experience, which profoundly impacted Muslim attitudes.
        
    - **Failure of Federation:** The non-implementation of the federal part meant the Centre remained under the old system, leaving crucial questions about central power-sharing unresolved. This failure kept the long-term constitutional structure uncertain.
        
    - **Basis for Future Constitutions:** Many provisions of the Act, particularly regarding the provincial structure and parliamentary procedures, influenced the post-independence constitutions of both India and Pakistan.
        
    - **Continued Communal Representation:** By retaining separate electorates, it continued to shape politics along communal lines.
        
- **Overall Assessment:** The Act was highly important. It marked the last major constitutional initiative by the British before independence. Its implementation at the provincial level was a significant development, but the failure of its federal component and its retention of communal representation left the core issues dividing Congress and the League unresolved, setting the stage for the final phase of the independence struggle.
    

**9. The 1937 Elections and their Significance**

- **Context:** Held under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, for the provincial legislatures.
    
- **Results:**
    
    - **Congress:** Achieved a massive victory, winning clear majorities in 5 out of 11 provinces (Madras, UP, Central Provinces, Bihar, Orissa) and emerging as the largest single party in several others, enabling it to form ministries in 7 (later 8) provinces.
        
    - **Muslim League:** Performed relatively poorly overall. It failed to win a majority in any of the Muslim-majority provinces (Punjab, Bengal, Sindh, NWFP). Regional parties dominated in Punjab (Unionist Party) and Bengal (Krishak Praja Party). However, the League did win a significant portion (though not a majority) of the seats reserved for Muslims, establishing itself as an important Muslim voice, particularly in Hindu-majority provinces.
        
- **Significance:**
    
    - **Demonstrated Congress Strength:** Confirmed Congress's position as the dominant political force across much of India.
        
    - **League's Weakness Exposed:** Highlighted the Muslim League's lack of mass support, particularly in Muslim-majority provinces where regional loyalties and leaders held sway. It was a major wake-up call for the League.
        
    - **Need for League Reorganization:** The poor showing spurred Jinnah and the League to launch concerted efforts to reorganise the party, expand its mass appeal, and challenge regional Muslim parties.
        
    - **Led to Congress Rule:** Congress's victory enabled it to form provincial governments, leading directly to the period of Congress Rule (1937-39).
        
    - **Coalition Question:** Congress, confident in its majority, generally refused to form coalition governments with the Muslim League in provinces like the United Provinces (UP), unless League members essentially dissolved their identity and joined Congress. This decision was deeply resented by the League and seen as evidence of Congress's intention to monopolize power.
        

**10. Congress Rule (1937–39), its Significance, and the ‘Day of Deliverance’ (1939)**

- **Context:** Following the 1937 elections, Congress formed ministries in 7 (later 8) provinces and remained in power for about 28 months.
    
- **Muslim League Allegations against Congress Rule:** The Muslim League accused the Congress provincial governments of discriminating against Muslims and promoting Hindu culture and interests. Key grievances included:
    
    - **Bande Mataram:** Congress promoted the singing of 'Bande Mataram' (a song from a novel depicting struggle against Muslim rulers) in legislative assemblies and schools, which many Muslims found offensive due to its perceived idolatrous content and anti-Muslim historical context.
        
    - **Wardha Scheme of Education:** An education scheme emphasizing handicrafts, basic learning, and Hindu ideals, which Muslims feared would neglect Urdu, Islamic studies, and Muslim culture.
        
    - **Hindi-Urdu Controversy:** Promotion of Hindi (using Devanagari script) at the expense of Urdu (using Perso-Arabic script), seen as an attack on Muslim cultural heritage.
        
    - **Congress Flag:** Hoisting the Congress tricolour flag on public buildings, seen as imposing a party symbol as a national symbol.
        
    - **Discrimination in Jobs/Services:** Allegations of favouritism towards Hindus in government appointments and suppression of Muslim representation.
        
    - **Communal Riots:** Accusations that Congress governments failed to protect Muslims adequately during communal riots.
        
- **League Reports:** The Muslim League published reports documenting these alleged grievances, most notably the **Pirpur Report (1938)** and the **Shareef Report (1939)**.
    
- **Congress Response:** Congress vehemently denied the allegations, arguing its policies were secular and non-discriminatory. They pointed to efforts to include Muslims and protect minority rights. Historians debate the extent and validity of the League's specific allegations, with some arguing they were exaggerated for political purposes, while others contend there were genuine grounds for Muslim anxieties and perceived slights.
    
- **Focus Area: Why was Congress Rule (1937–39) unpopular with many Muslims?**
    
    - **Fear of Hindu Majoritarianism:** The experience, whether fully accurate or partly perceived, convinced many Muslims that rule by a Congress majority (perceived as predominantly Hindu) would inevitably lead to the marginalization of Muslim culture, religion, language, and political interests in a future independent India.
        
    - **Cultural Insensitivity:** Specific policies like Bande Mataram and the emphasis on Hindi were seen as culturally insensitive and attempts to impose Hindu norms.
        
    - **Exclusion from Power:** The refusal of Congress to form coalition governments with the League in provinces like UP, despite the League's representation among Muslim seats, fostered a sense of political exclusion and confirmed fears of Congress's "totalitarian" tendencies.
        
    - **Effective League Propaganda:** The Muslim League, under Jinnah's revitalized leadership, effectively used these grievances (real or perceived) to rally Muslim support, portraying Congress rule as a taste of the "Hindu Raj" to come.
        
- **Significance of Congress Rule for Pakistan Movement:**
    
    - **Massive Boost to Muslim League:** This period was crucial in transforming the Muslim League from an elite organization into a mass movement. Muslims who had previously supported Congress or regional parties increasingly flocked to the League, seeing it as the only guarantor of their interests.
        
    - **Solidified Jinnah's Leadership:** Jinnah's strong stance against Congress during this time cemented his position as the undisputed leader (Quaid-i-Azam) of India's Muslims.
        
    - **Strengthened Separatist Sentiment:** The experience powerfully reinforced the argument that Muslims constituted a separate nation with distinct interests that could not be safeguarded within a united India dominated by Congress. It made the idea of Pakistan seem more necessary and urgent.
        
- **The ‘Day of Deliverance’ (December 22, 1939):**
    
    - **Context:** In October-November 1939, the Congress ministries resigned in protest against the Viceroy's declaration of India's entry into World War II without consulting Indian leaders.
        
    - **Jinnah's Call:** Jinnah called upon Muslims to observe December 22, 1939, as a "Day of Deliverance" to celebrate the end of Congress rule. He invited other minorities who felt aggrieved by Congress rule to join in.
        
    - **Purpose & Reaction:** It was intended as a public demonstration of relief from perceived Congress oppression. It was observed by many Muslims and some other minority groups, further highlighting the deep gulf between the League and Congress. Congress and nationalist leaders strongly criticized it as divisive and unpatriotic.
        
    - **Significance:** Symbolized the complete breakdown of trust between the League and Congress and publicly marked the League's position that Congress rule had been detrimental to Muslims, further consolidating support for the League and the idea of separation.

**Conclusion: Success of the Pakistan Movement (1927-1939)**

By the end of 1939, the Pakistan Movement, while not yet having formally demanded a separate state in the Lahore Resolution, had achieved significant success in laying the essential groundwork:

1. **Failure of Unity Efforts:** The period definitively demonstrated the failure of attempts (like the Delhi Proposals vs. Nehru Report, RTCs) to find a constitutional formula acceptable to both Congress and the League within a united framework.
    
2. **Articulation of Demands:** Muslim demands were clearly articulated, first through Jinnah's 14 Points, establishing non-negotiable principles for safeguarding Muslim interests.
    
3. **Ideological Development:** The philosophical basis for Muslim nationhood and separatism was powerfully put forth by Iqbal, and the name and concept of "Pakistan" were introduced by Rahmat Ali, providing ideological fuel.
    
4. **Consolidation of the Muslim League:** The Muslim League, particularly after the 1937 elections and under Jinnah's revitalized leadership, transformed itself from a relatively weak organization into the increasingly dominant voice of Muslim India, rapidly gaining mass support.
    
5. **Alienation from Congress:** The experience of Congress rule (1937-39) proved decisive in alienating a vast majority of politically conscious Muslims from Congress and convincing them that their future lay in separation. The 'Day of Deliverance' symbolized this deep divide.
    

Therefore, while Pakistan itself was not yet achieved, the years 1927-1939 were highly successful for the movement in terms of consolidating its support base, defining its core issues, developing its ideology, strengthening its organization and leadership, and creating the political conditions and widespread sentiment that made the demand for Pakistan in 1940 not only possible but seem necessary to a large and growing number of Indian Muslims.
