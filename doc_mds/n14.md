**Comprehensive Notes: Pakistan (1971-1988) - The Eras of Bhutto and Zia**

**Introduction:** Following the tumultuous end of Ayub Khan's 'Decade of Progress' (1958-1969) and the brief, crisis-ridden rule of Yahya Khan, Pakistan faced its most severe crisis: the 1971 war with India, resulting in the secession of East Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. This period marked a significant shift, bringing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a charismatic civilian leader, to power. His rule was followed by a long period of military dictatorship under General Zia-ul-Haq. These two decades (roughly 1971-1988) profoundly shaped Pakistan's political, social, and economic landscape.

---

**I. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (December 1971 – July 1977)**

Bhutto took charge of a demoralized and truncated Pakistan, initially as President and Chief Martial Law Administrator, later becoming Prime Minister under the 1973 Constitution. His era was marked by populist policies, significant reforms, and eventually, political turmoil leading to his overthrow.

**A. Controlling the Army:**

- **Context:** The military's prestige was at an all-time low after the 1971 defeat. Bhutto sought to assert civilian supremacy over the armed forces.
- **Actions:**
    - He forced the retirement of numerous senior army officers associated with the Yahya regime and the 1971 debacle, sometimes referred to as a "generals' purge."
    - He appointed Lieutenant General Gul Hassan Khan as Army Chief but dismissed him shortly after, along with Air Marshal Abdul Rahim Khan, asserting his authority.
    - He appointed General Tikka Khan, known for his loyalty and role in the 1971 operations, as the first Chief of Army Staff (a new designation replacing Commander-in-Chief).
    - Later, he controversially superseded several senior generals to appoint General Zia-ul-Haq as Chief of Army Staff in 1976, believing him to be apolitical and loyal.
    - He established the Federal Security Force (FSF), a paramilitary force directly under his control, ostensibly for internal security but widely seen as a personal force to counter potential military coups and suppress political opposition.
- **Success/Failure:** Bhutto initially succeeded in establishing civilian control, but his methods, particularly the creation and use of the FSF and the eventual appointment of Zia, contributed to resentment within the military establishment and ultimately failed to prevent his own overthrow by the army he sought to control.

**B. The Simla Agreement (July 2, 1972):**

- **Context:** Negotiated between Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in Simla, India, following the 1971 war.
- **Key Outcomes:**
    - Secured the release of approximately 93,000 Pakistani Prisoners of War (POWs) held by India.
    - India agreed to return over 5,000 square miles of Pakistani territory captured during the war.
    - Both countries agreed to respect the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir resulting from the December 1971 ceasefire.
    - Committed both nations to resolving differences peacefully through bilateral negotiations, implicitly reducing the role of third-party mediation (like the UN) in the Kashmir dispute.
- **Significance:** Considered a major diplomatic achievement for Bhutto, restoring national morale, securing the return of soldiers and territory, and establishing a framework for future India-Pakistan relations, albeit one often strained.

**C. A New Constitution (1973):**

- **Context:** Pakistan had struggled for a stable constitutional framework since independence. Previous constitutions (1956, 1962) were abrogated.
- **Features:**
    - Established a parliamentary system with a Prime Minister as head of government and a President as a largely ceremonial head of state.
    - Created a bicameral legislature (National Assembly and Senate).
    - Provided for provincial autonomy within a federal structure.
    - Enshrined fundamental rights for citizens.
    - Declared Pakistan an "Islamic Republic" and Islam the state religion.
    - Crucially, it was passed with consensus from all major political parties in the National Assembly.
    - Later amended (Second Amendment, 1974) to declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims.
- **Significance:** The 1973 Constitution remains Pakistan's fundamental legal document, demonstrating Bhutto's ability to forge political consensus early in his rule. Although suspended and heavily amended (notably by Zia), it has been repeatedly restored and serves as the basis for Pakistan's democratic structure.

**D. Reforms:** Bhutto implemented a wide range of reforms under the banner of "Islamic Socialism" and "Roti, Kapra aur Makaan" (Food, Clothing, and Shelter).

- **Industrial Reforms:**
    - **Nationalization:** In phases (1972 onwards), the government nationalized key industries (iron and steel, heavy engineering, chemicals, cement, utilities), banking, and insurance companies.
    - **Aims:** Reduce the concentration of wealth held by the "22 families," give the state control over the economy's "commanding heights," and improve workers' rights.
    - **Consequences:** Led to bureaucratic expansion and alleged inefficiency in state-run enterprises, discouraged private sector investment (both domestic and foreign), and alienated the powerful business community. Some argue it hampered long-term industrial growth.
- **Agricultural Reforms:**
    - **Land Reforms (1972 & 1977):** Lowered the ceilings on individual land ownership (from 500 irrigated/1000 non-irrigated acres under Ayub to 150 irrigated/300 non-irrigated acres, later reduced further). Land acquired was to be redistributed to landless tenants. Provided tenants with greater security of tenure.
    - **Aims:** Address rural inequality and empower landless peasants.
    - **Consequences:** Implementation was weak due to loopholes, landowner resistance, and bureaucratic hurdles. The actual amount of land redistributed was limited. However, it did grant greater security to some tenants and signalled a shift in focus towards rural masses.
- **Education Reforms (1972):**
    - **Nationalization:** Nationalized most private schools and colleges without compensation.
    - **Aims:** Provide free and universal education up to Class 10, create a more egalitarian system, and standardize curricula.
    - **Consequences:** Placed a huge financial burden on the government, expansion of access was slow, concerns arose about declining standards in formerly elite private institutions, and politicization of campuses increased. University expansion occurred, but quality remained an issue.
- **Health Reforms (1972):**
    - **Rural Focus:** Launched schemes to establish Basic Health Units (BHUs) and Rural Health Centres (RHCs) to improve healthcare access in underserved rural areas.
    - **Generic Drugs:** Introduced a scheme promoting generic drugs to make medicines cheaper.
    - **Aims:** Improve public health, particularly for the poor and rural populations.
    - **Consequences:** Implementation faced challenges with funding, staffing, and infrastructure. The generic drug scheme faced resistance from multinational pharmaceutical companies and some doctors. Progress was modest.
- **Social and Administrative Reforms:**
    - **Labour Policy (1972):** Strengthened trade unions, provided workers with greater share in profits, enhanced job security, and introduced pension schemes. This empowered labour but sometimes led to increased industrial unrest.
    - **Administrative Reforms (1973):** Abolished the elite Civil Service of Pakistan (CSP) cadre, replacing it with a unified structure (All-Pakistan Unified Grades). Aimed to end elitism and allow lateral entry, but critics argue it led to politicization of the bureaucracy and weakened its structure.

**E. Overthrow (July 5, 1977):**

- **Trigger:** The March 1977 general elections. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won a landslide victory, but the opposition coalition, the Pakistan National Alliance (PNA - a grouping of nine disparate parties, largely right-wing and religious), alleged massive, systematic rigging.
- **Events:**
    - The PNA launched a nationwide protest movement demanding Bhutto's resignation and fresh elections under a neutral administration. The movement adopted Islamic slogans ("Nizam-e-Mustafa" - System of the Prophet) contrasting with Bhutto's socialist rhetoric.
    - Protests involved strikes, demonstrations, and increasing violence, leading to a breakdown of law and order in major cities. Bhutto imposed martial law in Karachi, Lahore, and Hyderabad.
    - Negotiations between Bhutto and the PNA failed to reach a conclusive agreement despite reaching a near-settlement.
    - The military, under General Zia-ul-Haq (Bhutto's own appointee), citing the political deadlock and breakdown of law and order, staged a coup d'état code-named 'Operation Fair Play'.
    - Bhutto was arrested, the National Assembly dissolved, and the Constitution suspended. Zia promised elections within 90 days, a promise he would repeatedly break.
- **Underlying Causes:** While election rigging was the trigger, deeper causes included: alienation of key groups (business community, landlords affected by reforms, some religious groups), Bhutto's increasingly authoritarian style, suppression of dissent (including in Balochistan), the controversial role of the FSF, economic difficulties (partly due to global oil shocks and nationalization fallout), and the military's institutional interest in regaining power.

**F. How successful were the policies of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, 1971–77?**

- **Successes:**
    - Restored national confidence after the 1971 defeat.
    - Forged national consensus on the 1973 Constitution.
    - Successful diplomacy (Simla Agreement, hosting the 1974 Islamic Summit in Lahore, strengthening ties with China and Muslim world).
    - Initiated Pakistan's nuclear programme.
    - Raised political awareness among the masses ("Awami" politics).
    - Some reforms aimed at social equity (labour rights, attempted land reform) had positive intent, even if implementation was flawed.
- **Failures/Criticisms:**
    - Nationalization policies disrupted the economy, discouraged investment, and led to inefficiency.
    - Land reforms were largely ineffective in redistributing land.
    - Education and health reforms promised more than they delivered due to resource constraints and implementation issues.
    - Authoritarian tendencies grew; political opponents were harassed, the FSF was used repressively, and a major military operation was launched in Balochistan.
    - Alienated powerful segments of society (industrialists, some landowners, religious clergy).
    - The alleged rigging of the 1977 elections fatally undermined his legitimacy and triggered the crisis leading to his overthrow.
- **Overall Assessment:** Bhutto's era was transformative but deeply polarizing. He achieved significant political and diplomatic successes and introduced policies aimed at empowering the masses. However, economic mismanagement, growing authoritarianism, and political miscalculations led to widespread unrest and his eventual removal by the military. His legacy remains contested – hailed by supporters as a champion of the poor and national sovereignty, criticized by opponents for damaging the economy and democratic norms.

**II. General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (July 1977 – August 1988)**

Zia-ul-Haq seized power promising swift elections but remained in control for eleven years, ruling initially under Martial Law and later as President under a heavily amended Constitution. His rule was defined by Islamisation, military consolidation, and the strategic alignment with the West during the Soviet-Afghan War.

**A. The Islamisation Programme:**

- **Motivations:** Legitimise military rule, gain support from religious parties (who had backed the PNA), counter Bhutto's socialist legacy, personal religious conviction, and create a distinct national identity rooted in Islam.
- **Key Measures:**
    - **Hudood Ordinances (1979):** Introduced Islamic punishments for offences like theft (amputation), adultery and rape (stoning/lashing - _Zina_ Ordinance), false accusation of adultery (_Qazf_), and drinking alcohol (lashing). These were controversial, particularly the Zina Ordinance, which made it difficult for women to prove rape and could lead to victims being charged with adultery.
    - **Zakat and Ushr Ordinances (1980):** Introduced compulsory deduction of Zakat (2.5% wealth tax on certain assets) from bank accounts and Ushr (agricultural tax) to fund welfare for the needy. This was resisted by the Shia minority, leading to exemptions for them.
    - **Judicial Changes:** Established the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) to examine if laws were repugnant to Islam. Judges (_Ulema_) were appointed to benches in superior courts. Changes were made to the law of evidence (Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984), equating the testimony of two women to that of one man in certain financial cases.
    - **Economic Changes:** Efforts to eliminate interest (_Riba_) from banking led to the introduction of Profit and Loss Sharing (PLS) accounts.
    - **Social and Educational Measures:** Promotion of Arabic and Islamic studies in schools, enforcement of prayer times (_Namaz_) in government offices, directives for modest dress (particularly for women on state television), promotion of Urdu, and censorship of media content deemed un-Islamic.
- **Impact:** Profoundly reshaped Pakistan's legal and social fabric, empowering religious groups but also causing social divisions. It had a significant, often negative, impact on women and religious minorities. Its long-term effects on promoting religious extremism are still debated.

**B. Overview of the Constitutional and Islamic Legal Position of Women and Ethnic/Religious Minorities:**

- **Women:**
    - The Hudood Ordinances, especially the Zina Ordinance, significantly impacted women. The requirement of four adult Muslim male witnesses to prove rape made convictions nearly impossible, while a woman reporting rape could find herself accused of adultery if she couldn't meet this standard.
    - The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order (Law of Evidence) was seen as discriminatory by women's rights groups.
    - While promoting conservative norms, Zia's era did not completely halt women's participation in public life (e.g., women judges were appointed, women contested elections), but the legal framework created significant disadvantages and fostered a climate less conducive to women's rights.
- **Religious Minorities:**
    - Bhutto's government had declared Ahmadis non-Muslims (1974). Zia's regime intensified pressure through specific ordinances (e.g., Ordinance XX of 1984) restricting their religious practices.
    - Strengthening of Blasphemy Laws (Section 295-C of the Penal Code, mandating death penalty for blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad, added in 1986) increased vulnerability for minorities, as accusations could be misused.
    - The system of separate electorates (introduced earlier but reinforced by Zia) meant minorities voted for candidates from their own religion for reserved seats, marginalizing them from mainstream politics.
- **Ethnic Minorities:** While Islamisation was the dominant theme, underlying ethnic tensions (e.g., Sindhi nationalism, Baloch grievances) persisted. Zia largely managed these through a combination of patronage, suppression, and leveraging the Afghan conflict's dynamics.

**C. Law and Government, Elections, Martial Law, and the Eighth Amendment:**

- **Martial Law (1977-1985):** Zia ruled as Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). The Constitution was suspended, fundamental rights curtailed, military courts operated, and political activity was banned or severely restricted. Many politicians, including Bhutto (who was eventually executed in April 1979 after a controversial trial), were jailed.
- **Postponed Elections:** Zia repeatedly broke his initial promise of holding elections within 90 days, citing the need for accountability and Islamisation first.
- **1984 Referendum:** Held a controversial referendum asking citizens if they supported his Islamisation policies; a 'yes' vote was also interpreted as electing him President for five years. The official turnout and results were widely disputed.
- **1985 Non-Party Elections:** Held elections on a non-party basis, allowing individuals but not parties to contest. The PPP-led Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD) boycotted these elections.
- **Restoration of Constitution & Eighth Amendment (1985):** Before lifting Martial Law, Zia oversaw the passage of the Eighth Amendment to the 1973 Constitution.
    - It validated all actions taken during the Martial Law period.
    - Critically, it inserted Article 58(2)(b), granting the President discretionary power to dissolve the National Assembly and dismiss the Prime Minister if he felt the government could not function according to the Constitution.
    - This fundamentally shifted power from the elected Parliament/Prime Minister to the President (Zia himself), creating a semi-presidential system.
- **Post-Martial Law Period (1985-1988):** Zia appointed Muhammad Khan Junejo as Prime Minister from the newly elected non-party assembly. Junejo allowed political parties to function again and showed signs of independence, leading to friction with Zia. Zia abruptly dismissed Junejo's government in May 1988 using Article 58(2)(b), accusing it of corruption and slowing Islamisation. He promised new elections.

**D. Problems Facing Zia:**

- **Legitimacy Crisis:** As an unelected military ruler who overthrew a popular (though controversial) leader, Zia constantly struggled for legitimacy. Islamisation was partly an attempt to address this.
- **Political Opposition:** Faced consistent opposition from the PPP and other parties, grouped under the MRD alliance, which launched major protest movements (especially in 1983 in Sindh) that were harshly suppressed.
- **Economic Challenges:** Inherited economic problems, exacerbated by nationalization's legacy. However, the economy benefited significantly from remittances from Pakistani workers in the Gulf and massive foreign aid linked to the Afghan war.
- **Social Divisions:** Islamisation policies exacerbated sectarian tensions (Sunni-Shia) and alienated secular segments of society and women's groups.
- **International Pressure:** Initially faced some international isolation after the coup and Bhutto's execution, but this changed dramatically after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
- **Balancing Act:** Had to balance the demands of religious groups, the military establishment, political opposition, and international allies (especially the US).

**E. The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan (December 1979):**

- **Context:** The Soviet Union intervened militarily in Afghanistan to support a struggling communist regime.
- **Pakistan's Role:** Zia's Pakistan became a "frontline state" opposing the Soviet occupation. It provided refuge to millions of Afghan refugees (~3 million) and served as the primary conduit for massive US, Saudi, and international military and financial aid to the Afghan Mujahideen fighting the Soviets. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency played a central role in training and equipping the Mujahideen.
- **Consequences for Pakistan & Zia:**
    - **Geopolitical Boost:** Transformed Zia from an international pariah into a key US ally, significantly reducing pressure regarding democracy and human rights.
    - **Economic Aid:** Received billions in aid, boosting the economy.
    - **Military Strengthening:** Received advanced US weaponry.
    - **Refugee Burden:** Faced enormous social and economic strain from hosting millions of refugees.
    - **Internal Destabilisation:** Led to the proliferation of weapons ("Kalashnikov culture") and drugs within Pakistan, fueled extremism and militancy (blowback effect), and empowered the ISI significantly within the state structure.
    - **Prolonged Zia's Rule:** The strategic importance gained through the conflict helped Zia consolidate his power domestically.

**F. How successful were the policies of Zia-ul-Haq, 1977–88?**

- **Successes (from Zia's perspective/supporters):**
    - Maintained political stability (albeit through authoritarian means) for 11 years after the chaotic end of Bhutto's rule.
    - Successfully navigated the dangerous geopolitical situation created by the Soviet invasion, enhancing Pakistan's international standing and securing vital aid.
    - Presided over a period of reasonable economic growth (aided by remittances and foreign aid).
    - Implemented his Islamisation agenda, fulfilling demands of religious conservatives.
    - Significantly advanced Pakistan's nuclear weapons program under secrecy.
    - Strengthened the military's position within the state.
- **Failures/Criticisms:**
    - Severely damaged democratic institutions and norms through martial law, suppression of dissent, manipulation of elections, and the Eighth Amendment.
    - Islamisation policies were divisive, harmed the rights of women and minorities, and arguably contributed to long-term religious extremism and intolerance.
    - The Afghan war involvement, while strategically beneficial in the short term, had devastating long-term consequences regarding weaponization, drugs, and militancy.
    - Failed to resolve underlying ethnic and political tensions.
    - His rule ended abruptly with his death in a mysterious plane crash (August 17, 1988), leaving a legacy of constitutional imbalance and social fragmentation.
- **Overall Assessment:** Zia's success is highly debatable and depends heavily on perspective. He successfully maintained power for over a decade and positioned Pakistan advantageously during the Cold War's final phase. However, this came at the cost of democratic development, human rights, and social cohesion, leaving behind deep-seated problems related to religious extremism, constitutional imbalances (Article 58-2b), and the legacy of the Afghan conflict.

---

**Conclusion:** The two decades following Ayub Khan's era were tumultuous and transformative for Pakistan. Bhutto's period saw a surge of populism, significant reforms, the creation of a consensus constitution, but also economic disruption and political turmoil ending in a military coup. Zia's subsequent eleven-year rule imposed stability through military control, fundamentally altered Pakistan's legal and social landscape through Islamisation, and placed the country at the centre of a major geopolitical conflict. Both leaders left indelible marks on Pakistan, shaping its political trajectory, societal values, and challenges for decades to come. The period highlights the recurring tension between civilian democratic aspirations and military dominance, the complex interplay of religion and politics, and the profound impact of regional and international geopolitics on Pakistan's internal development.
