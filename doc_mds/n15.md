**Comprehensive Notes: Pakistan's Governments (1988-1999)**

**Introduction:** The period from 1988 to 1999 marked Pakistan's return to democracy after the Zia-ul-Haq dictatorship, but it was characterized by significant political instability, economic challenges, and a persistent power struggle between elected civilian governments, the Presidency (empowered by the 8th Amendment until 1997), and the military establishment. Neither Benazir Bhutto nor Nawaz Sharif completed a full term in office during this turbulent decade, which culminated in a military coup.

**I. Benazir Bhutto's First Term (1988–1990) - Pakistan People's Party (PPP)**

- **Context:** Elected after General Zia's death, Bhutto became the first female Prime Minister of a Muslim-majority country, riding a wave of popular support. However, her government faced constraints from the outset, operating under the shadow of a powerful President (Ghulam Ishaq Khan) and the military.
- **Conflict with Nawaz Sharif & Separatist Movements:**
    - Nawaz Sharif, as Chief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan's largest province) and head of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), became a major political rival. This federal-provincial conflict hampered governance and created political deadlock.
    - Sindh province experienced significant ethnic strife and separatist tensions, particularly involving the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) in urban centers like Karachi, leading to law and order challenges.
- **Difference with President Ishaq Khan over Appointments:**
    - Significant friction arose between PM Bhutto and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) over key appointments, particularly concerning the judiciary and the military hierarchy. GIK, a remnant of the Zia era, used his constitutional powers (under the 8th Amendment) to assert authority and limit Bhutto's control.
- **Opposition ‘No Confidence’ Motion (1989):**
    - The opposition, led by Nawaz Sharif and the IJI, launched a vote of no confidence against Bhutto's government. While the motion ultimately failed, it significantly weakened her administration, exposed its vulnerability, and consumed political energy that could have been used for governance. Allegations of bribery and "horse-trading" of parliamentarians were rampant.
- **Inflation and Unemployment:**
    - The government struggled to manage the economy. Persistent issues of high inflation and unemployment affected the populace and eroded public support. Effective economic policy implementation was hindered by political instability.
- **Issues in Kashmir:**
    - The late 1980s saw a significant escalation of the insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir. Bhutto's government adopted a vocal stance supporting the Kashmiri cause, which heightened tensions with India but also drew international scrutiny. Allegations of Pakistani support for militants increased.
- **Dismissal (August 1990):**
    - President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Bhutto's government using powers granted under the 8th Amendment of the Constitution.
    - **Reasons cited:** Allegations of widespread corruption, nepotism, failure to maintain law and order (particularly in Sindh), and political incompetence. The dismissal highlighted the precariousness of civilian rule under the powerful presidency.

**II. Nawaz Sharif's First Term (1990–1993) - Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) / Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N)**

- **Context:** Sharif came to power after the IJI coalition won the 1990 elections, which the PPP alleged were rigged. His government focused on economic liberalization and large infrastructure projects.
- **Privatisation Policy & Profiteering Concerns:**
    - Sharif launched an ambitious privatisation program, selling off state-owned enterprises. He also initiated major infrastructure projects like the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway and schemes like the "Yellow Cab" taxi program.
    - While aimed at boosting the economy, the privatisation process was heavily criticized for lacking transparency, leading to accusations of cronyism, undervaluation of assets, and facilitating profiteering by allies of the government.
- **Problems with BCCI:**
    - The collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in 1991 had significant repercussions. BCCI had extensive links within Pakistan, and its collapse led to financial losses and damaged Pakistan's international financial reputation.
- **Loss of US Aid:**
    - Pakistan's relationship with the US deteriorated. US aid was significantly curtailed under the Pressler Amendment due to concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program. Sharif's government's perceived support for Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War further strained relations.
- **Issues in Kashmir:**
    - Tensions with India over Kashmir remained high. Sharif's government continued Pakistan's policy of political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri insurgency, contributing to regional instability.
- **Removal of Sharif (1993):**
    - Like Bhutto before him, Sharif developed serious differences with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan over the limits of their respective powers, particularly concerning appointments and the scope of the 8th Amendment.
    - President GIK dismissed Sharif's government in April 1993 on charges of corruption, maladministration, and nepotism.
    - However, the Supreme Court of Pakistan overturned the dismissal in May 1993, reinstating Sharif's government – a landmark decision asserting judicial independence.
    - Despite reinstatement, the political deadlock continued. Under pressure from the Army Chief, General Abdul Waheed Kakar, both President Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif resigned in July 1993, paving the way for new elections.

**III. Benazir Bhutto's Second Term (1993–1996) - Pakistan People's Party (PPP)**

- **Context:** Bhutto returned to power after the PPP won the 1993 elections. Her own party loyalist, Farooq Leghari, was elected President, initially suggesting a smoother working relationship. However, this term was also plagued by instability and crisis.
- **Kashmir Tensions:**
    - The situation in Kashmir continued to be volatile. Bhutto's government maintained Pakistan's assertive stance, but international pressure grew on both India and Pakistan to de-escalate. The conflict remained a major foreign policy challenge and drain on resources.
- **Opposition Demonstrations:**
    - Nawaz Sharif, now in opposition, launched persistent campaigns and demonstrations against Bhutto's government, accusing it of corruption and incompetence. These protests often turned violent and contributed to political instability.
- **Unemployment/Inflation:**
    - The economy remained fragile. High unemployment and persistent inflation continued to plague the country, leading to public discontent. Structural economic weaknesses were difficult to address amidst political turmoil.
- **IMF Concerns & Devaluation:**
    - Pakistan faced severe economic difficulties, including a worsening balance of payments situation. The government repeatedly sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
    - IMF programs often required austerity measures and structural reforms, including the devaluation of the Pakistani Rupee. Devaluation aimed to boost exports but also increased the cost of imports and contributed to inflation, making the government unpopular.
- **Balance of Payments Issues:**
    - Chronic trade deficits and reliance on foreign loans and remittances led to recurring balance of payments crises, making Pakistan dependent on international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank.
- **Dismissal of the Chief Minister of Punjab:**
    - Political maneuvering continued. Bhutto's government was involved in orchestrating the removal of the PML-N Chief Minister of Punjab, Manzoor Wattoo (who was initially allied with the PPP but later fell out), highlighting the ongoing struggle for control in the key province.
- **Bhutto’s Dismissal (November 1996):**
    - Despite having her own party member as President, Bhutto's second term was cut short. President Farooq Leghari dismissed her government, again using the powers of the 8th Amendment.
    - **Reasons cited:** Widespread allegations of corruption (including scandals involving her husband, Asif Ali Zardari), economic mismanagement, and accusations of extra-judicial killings (notably, the controversial death of her estranged brother, Murtaza Bhutto, in a police encounter in Karachi).

**IV. Nawaz Sharif's Second Term (1997–1999) - Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N)**

- **Context:** Sharif returned to power with a huge parliamentary majority ("heavy mandate") in the 1997 elections, giving him unprecedented political strength.
- **Consolidation of Power:**
    - Sharif moved swiftly to consolidate power. His government passed the 13th Amendment, removing the President's power under the 8th Amendment to unilaterally dismiss the Prime Minister and Parliament. He also passed the 14th Amendment (anti-defection law) to strengthen party discipline.
- **Conflict with Judiciary:**
    - Sharif's government clashed with the judiciary under Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah. This culminated in the infamous storming of the Supreme Court building by PML-N supporters in 1997, leading to the Chief Justice's eventual removal. This act was widely condemned as an assault on judicial independence.
- **Nuclear Tests (May 1998):**
    - In response to India's nuclear tests, Sharif's government conducted Pakistan's own nuclear tests. While domestically popular and seen as achieving strategic parity, the tests triggered international condemnation and led to economic sanctions, primarily from the US and its allies, worsening Pakistan's already fragile economy.
- **Economic Difficulties:**
    - The sanctions imposed after the nuclear tests severely impacted the economy. Foreign exchange reserves dwindled, and Pakistan again faced balance of payments difficulties, forcing it back to the IMF under stringent conditions.
- **Kargil Conflict (1999):**
    - The Pakistani military, allegedly without Sharif's full initial approval of the scale, infiltrated troops into the Kargil sector of Indian-administered Kashmir. This led to a limited but intense conflict with India.
    - Under heavy international pressure (especially from the US) and facing military setbacks, Sharif ordered a withdrawal. This was seen as a national humiliation by many, including within the military establishment, and severely strained civil-military relations.
- **Removal of Sharif & Imposition of Military Rule (October 1999):**
    - Relations between Sharif and the Army Chief, General Pervez Musharraf, deteriorated rapidly after Kargil. Sharif attempted to dismiss Musharraf while the General was returning from an overseas trip.
    - The military reacted swiftly, preventing Musharraf's plane from landing initially, then securing airports and key government buildings. They overthrew Sharif's government in a bloodless coup on October 12, 1999.
    - General Musharraf took control, suspended the constitution, and declared a state of emergency, ending Pakistan's decade-long experiment with unstable parliamentary democracy.

**Focus Area Analysis:**

- **How successful were the policies of Benazir Bhutto (1988–90, 1993–96)?**
    
    - **Overall Limited Success:** While Bhutto held symbolic importance as the first female leader and initiated some social programs, her policy effectiveness was severely hampered.
    - **Political Instability:** Both terms were consumed by political battles – with the President (GIK), the opposition (Sharif), provincial governments (Punjab, Sindh), and eventually her own President (Leghari). This prevented consistent policy implementation.
    - **Economic Challenges:** Her governments struggled with persistent inflation, unemployment, and balance of payments crises, leading to unpopular IMF programs and devaluations. Corruption allegations further undermined economic management.
    - **Establishment Constraints:** The powerful military and presidency (under the 8th Amendment) constrained her ability to govern effectively.
    - **Incomplete Terms:** Being dismissed twice before completing a term prevented any long-term policy initiatives from bearing fruit. Her legacy is more defined by the struggle for power and survival rather than transformative policy success.
- **How successful were the policies of Nawaz Sharif (1990–93, 1997–99)?**
    
    - **Mixed Success, Ultimately Undermined:** Sharif showed more inclination towards economic reforms and infrastructure development than Bhutto, but his tenures were also marred by instability and controversy.
    - **Economic Initiatives:** His privatisation drive and infrastructure projects (like the Motorway) were significant initiatives, although plagued by criticisms of cronyism and lack of transparency. In his second term, the economy suffered greatly due to post-nuclear test sanctions.
    - **Consolidation & Confrontation:** In his second term, he successfully removed the presidential power to dismiss governments (13th Amendment), a major constitutional achievement. However, this was overshadowed by his authoritarian tendencies, evidenced by the conflict with the judiciary and the eventual fatal clash with the military.
    - **Foreign Policy:** His first term saw strained US relations. His second term included the popular but economically damaging nuclear tests and the disastrous Kargil conflict, which damaged international standing and destroyed civil-military trust.
    - **Incomplete Terms:** Like Bhutto, he failed to complete either term, being dismissed by the President in the first and overthrown by the military in the second. His attempts at economic liberalization and later power consolidation were ultimately unsuccessful in ensuring stable governance.
- **Why did General Musharraf take power in 1999?**
    
    - **Breakdown of Civil-Military Relations:** This was the immediate trigger. Sharif's attempt to sack Army Chief Musharraf while he was airborne was seen by the military command as an unacceptable and destabilizing move, prompting them to act decisively to protect their chief and the institution.
    - **Kargil Conflict Fallout:** The handling and outcome of the Kargil War created deep mistrust and resentment between the civilian government and the military high command. The military felt scapegoated for a withdrawal ordered by the civilian leadership under international pressure.
    - **Sharif's Authoritarian Actions:** Sharif's growing authoritarianism, including the removal of the 8th Amendment, the conflict with the Supreme Court, and attempts to further concentrate power (e.g., proposing a Shariat Bill that would grant him sweeping authority), alienated key institutions and raised concerns about the direction of the country.
    - **Perceived Governance Failures:** Despite the heavy mandate, Sharif's government faced economic hardship (exacerbated by sanctions), allegations of corruption, and political confrontation. The military likely perceived a vacuum of effective governance.
    - **Military's Institutional Interests & Historical Role:** The Pakistan Army has historically viewed itself as the ultimate arbiter and guarantor of national stability and integrity. Faced with what it perceived as a direct threat to its leadership and institutional coherence, and citing concerns over national interest after Kargil and Sharif's actions, the military intervened, falling back on its historical pattern of involvement in politics.

**Conclusion:** The final decade of the 20th century in Pakistan was largely ineffective in terms of stable, democratic governance. Both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif struggled against entrenched institutional forces (presidency and military), persistent economic problems, internal political rivalries, and allegations of corruption. Their inability to complete terms and manage civil-military relations effectively led to chronic instability, culminating in the military coup of 1999, which once again derailed Pakistan's democratic process. The period highlights the immense challenges faced by civilian governments in asserting authority and delivering consistent policy outcomes within Pakistan's complex political landscape.
