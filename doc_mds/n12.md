**Comprehensive Notes: Stability in Pakistan Post-Jinnah (1948-1973)**

**Introduction: The Context of Instability**

Following the death of its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in September 1948, Pakistan faced immense challenges that severely tested its stability:

1. **Leadership Vacuum:** Jinnah's towering presence and authority were irreplaceable. His successors struggled to command similar respect and unity.
2. **Administrative Chaos:** Setting up a new state machinery from scratch, especially with the influx of millions of refugees and the division of assets with India, was a monumental task.
3. **Economic Hardship:** Partition disrupted established economic patterns. Pakistan lacked industry, capital, and infrastructure. The refugee crisis added immense strain.
4. **Constitutional Delay:** Agreement on a constitution defining the state's structure, ideology, and power distribution proved elusive, leading to prolonged political uncertainty.
5. **Regional Disparities & Identity:** Balancing the demands and identities of diverse regions, particularly the geographically separated East and West wings, was a constant challenge.
6. **Security Concerns:** Hostile relations with India, particularly over Kashmir, necessitated heavy defence spending and influenced foreign policy.

These factors created a fragile environment where achieving lasting stability became the central political struggle for decades.

**I. Early Years (1948-1958): Political Turmoil and Constitutional Crisis**

This period was marked by frequent changes in government, power struggles between heads of state and prime ministers, provincial tensions, and the assassination of the first Prime Minister.

- **Khwaja Nazimuddin (Governor-General 1948-51, Prime Minister 1951-53)**
    
    - **As Governor-General:** Succeeded Jinnah as Head of State, largely a ceremonial role initially. Provided continuity but lacked Jinnah's decisive leadership.
    - **As Prime Minister:** Took over after Liaquat Ali Khan's assassination.
        - **Achievements:** Continued efforts towards constitution-making (Basic Principles Committee reports). Maintained administrative functions despite difficulties.
        - **Challenges & Failures:** Faced severe food shortages (leading to riots), growing provincialism, and the divisive Language Movement in East Pakistan (demanding Bengali be a national language alongside Urdu). Accused of weak leadership and indecisiveness.
        - **Instability Factor:** His controversial dismissal in April 1953 by Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad, despite commanding a majority in the Assembly, set a dangerous precedent for the Head of State undermining parliamentary democracy and significantly destabilized the political system.
- **Liaquat Ali Khan (Prime Minister 1947-1951)**
    
    - **Achievements:**
        - **Objectives Resolution (1949):** Successfully steered the passage of this crucial document outlining the guiding principles for the future constitution (discussed later).
        - **Economic Planning:** Established the Planning Board to guide economic development. Secured membership in the World Bank and IMF. Resisted devaluing the Rupee initially.
        - **Administration:** Worked to establish the civil service and administrative structures. Introduced PRODA (Public and Representative Office Disqualification Act) to combat corruption, though it was sometimes used politically.
        - **Foreign Policy:** Aligned Pakistan firmly with the West (especially the US) during the Cold War, seeking economic and military aid. Visited the US in 1950. Managed initial relations with India, including the Liaquat-Nehru Pact (1950) concerning minority rights.
    - **Challenges:** Faced constant political infighting, the unresolved Kashmir dispute, the refugee crisis, and provincial rivalries.
    - **Instability Factor:** His assassination in October 1951 created a significant leadership vacuum and added to the sense of uncertainty and instability.
- **Ghulam Muhammad (Governor-General 1951-1955)**
    
    - **Actions & Impact:** A former bureaucrat, he significantly increased the power of the Governor-General's office.
        - **Dismissal of Nazimuddin (1953):** Undermined parliamentary supremacy.
        - **Dissolution of the Constituent Assembly (1954):** When the Assembly tried to curb his powers, he dissolved it, plunging the country into a major constitutional crisis. This was controversially upheld by the courts under the 'doctrine of necessity'.
        - **Formation of 'Ministry of Talents':** Brought non-politicians (including military commander Ayub Khan as Defence Minister) into the cabinet, increasing bureaucratic-military influence.
    - **Instability Factor:** His actions severely damaged democratic norms, concentrated power in the un-elected Head of State, delayed constitution-making, and paved the way for future authoritarian interventions. He prioritized executive power over democratic processes, contributing massively to instability.
- **Iskander Mirza (Governor-General/President 1955-1958)**
    
    - **Actions & Impact:** Continued the trend of executive dominance.
        - **One Unit Scheme (1955):** Merged the provinces of West Pakistan into a single unit, ostensibly for administrative efficiency and to create parity with East Pakistan. However, it fuelled resentment among smaller provinces.
        - **Promulgation of 1956 Constitution:** Oversaw the adoption of Pakistan's first constitution, making Pakistan an Islamic Republic. Became the first President.
        - **Political Manipulation:** Known for political intrigue, frequently changing prime ministers (4 PMs between 1956-1958) and undermining political parties to maintain his own power.
        - **Abrogation of Constitution & Martial Law (1958):** Citing political instability (which he had helped create), he abrogated the 1956 Constitution, dismissed the government, dissolved assemblies, banned political parties, and declared Martial Law in October 1958, appointing General Ayub Khan as Chief Martial Law Administrator. Shortly after, Ayub Khan deposed Mirza himself.
    - **Instability Factor:** While presiding over the creation of the first constitution, his constant political maneuvering and eventual abrogation of the constitution demonstrated the fragility of democratic institutions and directly led to the first military takeover, representing a complete collapse of the initial political order.
- **Focus Area: Main Achievements of Various Ministries (1948–58)**
    
    - **Laying Foundations:** Establishing basic administrative structures, civil services, and diplomatic relations.
    - **Objectives Resolution (1949):** A key ideological statement, though its interpretation remained contested.
    - **Economic Management:** Joining international financial institutions, initial planning efforts (Colombo Plan).
    - **Foreign Alliances:** Securing Western alignment (SEATO - 1954, Baghdad Pact/CENTO - 1955) for aid and security.
    - **1956 Constitution:** A major milestone, finally providing a constitutional framework (Islamic Republic, Parliamentary System, Federalism), although short-lived.
    - **Overall Assessment (Stability):** Despite these specific achievements, the period was characterized by _profound instability_. Key failures included: inability to maintain stable parliamentary government, excessive interference by Heads of State, failure to resolve provincial tensions (Language Movement, One Unit), delay in constitution-making, and the eventual collapse of the democratic system into military rule.

**II. Muhammad Ayub Khan and the ‘Decade of Progress’ (1958–1969)**

Ayub Khan ruled Pakistan for over ten years, first as Chief Martial Law Administrator and then as President under his own 1962 Constitution. His era is often called the 'Decade of Progress' due to economic growth but was marked by authoritarian rule.

- **Domestic Reforms & Policies:**
    
    - **Political System:** Abrogated the 1956 Constitution. Introduced the 'Basic Democracies' system (1959) – an indirect electoral system creating tiers of councils from local to provincial levels, forming an electoral college for the President and assemblies. Critics saw it as a way to control political participation and legitimize his rule. Promulgated the 1962 Constitution (discussed later).
    - **Economic Reforms:** Focused on industrialization (import substitution), attracting foreign investment, and agricultural development. Land reforms were introduced but had limited impact on feudal structures. The 'Green Revolution' (use of high-yield seeds, fertilizers, irrigation) significantly increased agricultural output, particularly wheat and rice. Large-scale industrial projects were undertaken.
    - **Administrative Reforms:** Attempted to streamline administration. Shifted the capital from Karachi to the newly built Islamabad.
    - **Social Reforms:** Introduced the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (1961), which placed restrictions on polygamy and regulated marriage and divorce, meeting resistance from religious conservatives.
- **Foreign Policy:**
    
    - **Continued Western Alignment:** Initially maintained strong ties with the US, receiving significant economic and military aid. Pakistan provided the US with facilities (e.g., Badaber airbase near Peshawar).
    - **Indus Waters Treaty (1960):** A major success, resolving the long-standing water dispute with India, brokered by the World Bank.
    - **Shift Towards China:** Following the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and disillusionment with Western support (especially during the 1965 war), Ayub fostered closer ties with China.
    - **1965 War with India:** Initiated conflict over Kashmir, which ended in a stalemate (Tashkent Declaration). The war damaged the economy, exposed military vulnerabilities, and led to public disillusionment, particularly in East Pakistan which felt neglected and undefended.
- **Focus Area: Achievements of the ‘Decade of Progress’ (1958–69)**
    
    - **Economic Growth:** Impressive GDP growth rates, significant industrial development, and marked improvement in agricultural output (Green Revolution). Infrastructure development (dams like Mangla, highways, Islamabad).
    - **Political Stability (Authoritarian):** Enforced political stability after the chaos of the 1950s, albeit through authoritarian control, suppression of dissent, and a controlled political system.
    - **Foreign Policy Successes:** Indus Waters Treaty, building relationship with China.
    - **Administrative Centralization:** Streamlined administration to some extent.
    - **Failures & Costs:**
        - **Democracy Suppressed:** Political freedom curtailed, parties banned initially, press controlled, opponents jailed.
        - **Economic Inequality:** Wealth became concentrated in the hands of a few families (the "22 families" narrative).
        - **Regional Disparities:** Economic gains primarily benefited West Pakistan, deepening grievances in East Pakistan. The Basic Democracies system also alienated the Bengali elite.
        - **1965 War:** A costly misadventure that damaged the economy and Ayub's prestige.
        - **Authoritarianism Breeds Instability:** The suppression of democratic aspirations and regional grievances ultimately fuelled massive popular protests in both East and West Pakistan, forcing Ayub Khan's resignation in March 1969.
    - **Overall Assessment (Stability):** Ayub Khan brought a period of _superficial_ stability and significant economic development. However, this stability was imposed, undemocratic, and ultimately unsustainable because it ignored fundamental political and regional issues. His authoritarian rule bred deep resentment that erupted and led to his downfall and further instability.

**III. Yahya Khan (1969-1971): Transition, Crisis, and Breakup**

General Yahya Khan took over from Ayub Khan, promising a return to democracy, but his rule ended in the tragic breakup of Pakistan.

- **Actions & Policies:**
    - **Abrogation of 1962 Constitution & Martial Law:** Imposed martial law upon taking power.
    - **Political Concessions:** Abrogated the unpopular 'One Unit' scheme, restoring the old provinces in West Pakistan. Dissolved the Basic Democracies system.
    - **Legal Framework Order (LFO) 1970:** Outlined the rules for the upcoming general election and future constitution-making. Crucially, it allocated seats based on population (giving East Pakistan a majority in the National Assembly) and set a deadline for the new assembly to frame a constitution.
    - **1970 General Elections:** Held Pakistan's first truly free and fair general elections based on universal adult franchise. The results were starkly polarized: Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Awami League (advocating extensive provincial autonomy via its Six Points) swept East Pakistan, while Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won decisively in West Pakistan (primarily Punjab and Sindh).
    - **Failure to Transfer Power:** Yahya Khan, influenced by Bhutto and West Pakistani establishment fears of Bengali domination and the implications of the Six Points, postponed the convening of the National Assembly scheduled for March 1971.
    - **Military Crackdown in East Pakistan (Operation Searchlight):** In response to protests and the civil disobedience movement launched by the Awami League, the army launched a brutal crackdown in East Pakistan on March 25, 1971. This led to widespread atrocities, a massive refugee influx into India, and the declaration of independence by Bengali nationalists, sparking the Bangladesh Liberation War.
    - **1971 War with India:** India intervened militarily in support of the Bengali forces. The Pakistani military in the East surrendered in Dhaka on December 16, 1971.
- **Instability Factor:** Yahya Khan's regime represents the ultimate failure to maintain stability. While he took positive steps initially by holding elections, his failure to respect the democratic mandate and subsequent military action led directly to civil war, genocide (as argued by Bangladesh and others), defeat in war with India, and the dismemberment of the country with the creation of Bangladesh. This was the most profound instability Pakistan had faced. He handed over power to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the truncated West Pakistan.

**IV. Constitutional Development (1949-1973)**

The struggle for a viable constitution was central to Pakistan's quest for stability.

- **The Objectives Resolution (1949)**
    
    - **Origin:** Need to define the ideological basis and guiding principles for the state after Jinnah's death.
    - **Reasons for Adoption:** To provide a framework for constitution-making, address demands from religious groups for an Islamic state, and unify diverse political factions around core principles. Passed by the first Constituent Assembly under Liaquat Ali Khan.
    - **Principles:**
        - Sovereignty belongs to Allah Almighty, delegated to the state through its people.
        - Principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance, and social justice as enunciated by Islam shall be fully observed.
        - Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives 1 according to the teachings of Islam.

            ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_Pakistan)
            
        - Minorities' rights, religious freedom, and legitimate interests shall be protected.
        - Fundamental rights guaranteed.
        - Judiciary shall be independent.
        - Federal structure.
    - **Islamic Provisions:** Explicit reference to Allah's sovereignty, enabling Muslims to live according to Islamic teachings, adherence to Islamic principles of social justice.
    - **Significance:** Became the preamble to the 1956, 1962, and 1973 constitutions (and later made a substantive part of the 1973 Constitution). It represented an attempt to blend Islamic identity with modern democratic governance, but its interpretation remained a source of debate.
- **The 1956 Constitution**
    
    - **Reasons:** To end the constitutional deadlock following the dissolution of the first Constituent Assembly, provide a democratic framework, and establish parity between East and West Pakistan (aided by the One Unit scheme).
    - **Principles:** Parliamentary system, Federalism (with parity between East and West Wings), Unicameral legislature.
    - **Islamic Provisions:**
        - Declared Pakistan an "Islamic Republic".
        - Objectives Resolution included as the preamble.
        - Required the President to be a Muslim.
        - Stated that no law should be enacted repugnant to the injunctions of Islam.
        - Provided for an organization to assist in the reconstruction of Muslim society on a truly Islamic basis.
    - **Fate:** Abrogated by Iskander Mirza/Ayub Khan in October 1958 after only two and a half years, due to political instability and executive interference.
- **The 1962 Constitution**
    
    - **Reasons:** Ayub Khan believed the parliamentary system was unsuited to Pakistan and desired a stronger executive (himself) to ensure stability and development. Imposed by presidential decree, not passed by a representative assembly.
    - **Principles:** Presidential system with vast powers concentrated in the President, Indirect elections through Basic Democracies, Weak legislature (initially unicameral), Federal structure but highly centralized.
    - **Islamic Provisions:**
        - Initially dropped "Islamic" from the Republic's name (restored later by amendment).
        - Objectives Resolution retained as preamble.
        - President required to be Muslim.
        - Included a principle that laws should conform to Islamic teachings but gave this less direct legal force than the 1956 version.
        - Established an Advisory Council of Islamic Ideology to advise the legislature.
    - **Fate:** Lacked popular legitimacy due to its undemocratic nature and concentration of power. Failed to address regional grievances (especially East Pakistan). Abrogated by Yahya Khan in 1969 following mass protests against Ayub Khan.
- **The 1973 Constitution**
    
    - **Reasons:** Urgently needed after the trauma of 1971 to provide a consensus-based framework for the remaining (West) Pakistan, restore parliamentary democracy, and address issues of provincial autonomy. Drafted and passed by a directly elected National Assembly under Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.
    - **Principles:** Parliamentary system (Prime Minister as head of government, President as ceremonial head of state), Bicameral legislature (National Assembly and Senate, providing provincial representation), Federalism with more provincial autonomy (though eroded later), Fundamental Rights guaranteed.
    - **Islamic Provisions:**
        - Declared Pakistan an "Islamic Republic" and Islam the state religion.
        - Objectives Resolution included first as preamble, later (under Zia-ul-Haq) made a substantive part (Article 2A).
        - Required both President and Prime Minister to be Muslim.
        - Stated that all existing laws shall be brought into conformity with the Injunctions of Islam, and no law repugnant to such Injunctions shall be enacted.
        - Strengthened the Council of Islamic Ideology and established the Federal Shariat Court (later under Zia).
        - Defined who is a Muslim (specifically excluding Ahmadis, via a later amendment in 1974).
    - **Significance:** Achieved a broad national consensus at the time of its adoption. It remains Pakistan's constitution today, although it has been significantly amended numerous times, particularly during periods of military rule (Zia-ul-Haq, Pervez Musharraf), often shifting the balance of power and altering its original spirit.
- **Focus Area: Attempts to Establish a New Constitution (1949–73)**
    
    - The period saw a protracted and difficult journey towards establishing a lasting constitutional framework.
    - **1949-1956:** Long delay marked by debate over ideology (role of Islam), power-sharing between wings, provincial rights, and executive interference (Ghulam Muhammad's dissolution of the Assembly). Culminated in the short-lived 1956 Constitution.
    - **1958-1969:** Ayub Khan discarded the parliamentary model and imposed his own presidential system via the 1962 Constitution, prioritizing centralized control and his vision of stability over democratic consensus. This proved unsustainable.
    - **1969-1973:** Yahya Khan oversaw elections under the LFO intended to lead to a new constitution, but the political crisis led to the country's breakup. The post-1971 period under Bhutto finally resulted in the 1973 Constitution, achieved through broad political consensus in the remaining Pakistan, returning to a parliamentary system but with significantly enhanced Islamic provisions compared to previous attempts.

**Conclusion: The Elusive Quest for Stability**

Did Pakistan achieve stability following the death of Jinnah? The period from 1948 to 1973 demonstrates that **lasting stability was not achieved.**

- The initial decade (1948-58) was characterized by political musical chairs, weak democratic institutions vulnerable to executive overreach, constitutional crises, and the failure to integrate the diverse regions effectively.
- The Ayub Khan era (1958-69) provided economic growth and a facade of order, but this stability was authoritarian, built on suppressing democratic rights and regional aspirations, ultimately proving fragile and leading to widespread revolt.
- The Yahya Khan period (1969-71) saw the complete breakdown of stability, culminating in civil war and the dismemberment of the nation.
- While the 1973 Constitution represented a significant achievement in consensus-building for the remaining Pakistan, the preceding 25 years were largely defined by instability.

The key factors hindering stability were: the weakness of political institutions and leadership, unresolved questions about national identity and the role of Islam, persistent civil-military imbalances (with the military and bureaucracy often overriding political processes), failure to address regional grievances (especially in East Pakistan), and economic vulnerabilities. The legacy of this turbulent period continued to shape Pakistan's political trajectory long after 1973.
