**Comprehensive Notes: The Establishment of Independent Pakistan (1947-1948)**

**Introduction:** The birth of Pakistan on August 14, 1947, was the culmination of a long political struggle, but the establishment of a viable, independent nation faced immediate and severe challenges. The period between 1947 and 1948 was critical, marked by immense difficulties ranging from border disputes and mass migration to administrative collapse and economic fragility. Assessing the success of this period involves understanding the magnitude of the problems, the effectiveness of the responses, and the crucial role played by leadership, particularly that of Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

**1. Outcome of the Radcliffe Award and Reactions**

- **The Award:** Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a British lawyer with no prior experience in India, chaired two Boundary Commissions (one for Punjab, one for Bengal) to divide these provinces between India and Pakistan. The final award was announced on August 17, 1947, _after_ independence had already been declared.
- **Outcome & Controversy:** The partition line, especially in Punjab, proved highly controversial.
    - **Gurdaspur District:** Several Muslim-majority tehsils (sub-districts) within Gurdaspur were awarded to India. This decision was particularly contentious as it provided India with a land route to the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir, which would otherwise have been accessible only through Pakistan.
    - **Ferozepur District:** Key canal headworks controlling water flow vital for Pakistani Punjab were located in areas awarded to India (e.g., Ferozepur headworks).
    - **Calcutta:** The major city and port of Calcutta, despite having a large Muslim population and being economically linked to East Bengal (which became East Pakistan), was awarded to India.
- **Reactions:**
    - **Pakistan:** The government and public reacted with shock and dismay, viewing the award as unjust and biased, potentially influenced by the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, in favour of India. The allocation of Gurdaspur and key headworks was seen as deliberately crippling Pakistan.
    - **India:** While generally accepting the award, there were also some areas of dissatisfaction on the Indian side, though less pronounced than Pakistan's reaction.
- **Impact on People:**
    - **Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs:** The announcement _after_ independence, amid rising communal tensions, created chaos and uncertainty. Millions found themselves on the "wrong" side of the border. It triggered horrific communal violence, particularly in Punjab, as terrified populations attempted to migrate. Sikhs, whose community and holy sites were split across the Punjab border, were particularly affected, leading to widespread violence against Muslims in East Punjab and vice-versa in West Punjab. This directly fuelled the refugee crisis.

**2. The Canal Water Dispute**

- **The Problem:** The Radcliffe Award split the integrated irrigation system of the Indus Basin, leaving the headworks of canals irrigating vast areas of Pakistani Punjab (like the Upper Bari Doab Canal) in Indian territory. Pakistan's agricultural economy was heavily reliant on this water.
- **Course:** In April 1948, India cut off water supplies from the Ferozepur and Madhopur headworks to canals flowing into Pakistan, claiming that Pakistan had lost its water rights with partition. This action threatened catastrophic famine in Pakistan.
- **Resolution (Initial & Long-term):**
    - **Immediate:** Intense negotiations led to the Inter-Dominion Agreement in May 1948. Pakistan conceded India's right to diminish water supply gradually upon payment, essentially buying its own water as a temporary measure. This temporarily restored flow but did not solve the underlying dispute.
    - **UN Mediation & Later Resolution:** The issue remained a major source of friction. Mediation by the World Bank, starting in 1952, eventually led to the **Indus Waters Treaty** signed in 1960. This treaty allocated the waters of the eastern rivers (Sutlej, Beas, Ravi) to India and the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan, providing a long-term, though sometimes contested, resolution.
- **Success (1947-48):** The immediate attempts in 1948 only provided a temporary, disadvantageous truce for Pakistan. The problem was _not_ successfully resolved in this initial period and remained a critical vulnerability.

**3. Division of Assets**

- **The Agreement:** British India's assets, including financial reserves (cash balances held by the Reserve Bank of India), military equipment, railways, government records, and other movable assets, were to be divided. The agreed ratio was roughly 17.5% for Pakistan and 82.5% for India.
- **Problems:** India was slow and reluctant to transfer Pakistan's share.
    - **Financial:** Pakistan's share of the cash balances was approximately Rs 750 million. India initially withheld this, linking payment to the Kashmir dispute.
    - **Military:** The division of military assets (weapons, vehicles, ordnance factories) was particularly problematic. Pakistan received very little functional equipment initially; much of what was earmarked was old, damaged, or withheld by India. Ordnance factories were all located in India.
- **Resolution (Partial):** Following pressure, including a fast by Mahatma Gandhi who saw withholding the funds as immoral, India released a portion (around Rs 550 million) of Pakistan's share of the cash balances in January 1948. However, the transfer of military assets remained largely incomplete and unsatisfactory for Pakistan.
- **Success?** Partially successful regarding the cash reserves due to external pressure (Gandhi). However, the overall process was fraught with difficulty and delay, significantly hampering Pakistan's ability to establish its administration and armed forces. Pakistan felt unjustly deprived of its rightful share.

**4. Problems with the Princely States (Especially Jammu and Kashmir)**

- **The Issue:** Over 560 Princely States, technically autonomous under British paramountcy, were given the choice by the Indian Independence Act (1947) to accede to either India or Pakistan, considering geographical contiguity and the wishes of their people. Independence was discouraged.
- **Major Problem Areas:**
    - **Junagadh:** A state with a Hindu majority but a Muslim ruler who acceded to Pakistan. India refused to accept this, citing the population's wishes and geographical absurdity (it was surrounded by Indian territory), eventually annexing it after a plebiscite.
    - **Hyderabad:** A large, wealthy state with a Muslim ruler (Nizam) and a Hindu majority. The Nizam desired independence. India imposed an economic blockade and eventually annexed it through military action ("Operation Polo") in September 1948.
    - **Jammu and Kashmir:** A state with a Muslim majority population but a Hindu ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh. It bordered both India (post-Radcliffe Award) and Pakistan. The Maharaja initially hesitated, hoping for independence.
        - _Conflict Erupts:_ Following reports of persecution of Muslims and a local uprising, Pashtun tribesmen from Pakistan invaded Kashmir in October 1947, with unofficial backing from some Pakistani elements.
        - _Accession to India:_ Facing the tribal advance, Maharaja Hari Singh acceded to India on October 26, 1947, in return for military assistance. Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar.
        - _First Indo-Pak War:_ This led to the first war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir (1947-1948).
- **UN Mediation:** India took the Kashmir issue to the UN Security Council in January 1948. The UN passed resolutions calling for a ceasefire (established January 1, 1949) and a plebiscite to determine the future affiliation of the state, conditional on the withdrawal of Pakistani forces and the bulk of Indian forces. The plebiscite was never held due to disagreements over the withdrawal conditions.
- **Success?** A major failure of the partition process. Pakistan failed to secure the accession of the strategically vital and Muslim-majority Kashmir. India secured the accession but faced a protracted conflict and international dispute. The Kashmir issue became the core point of contention and future wars between India and Pakistan.

**5. Refugee and Accommodation Crisis**

- **The Scale:** The partition triggered one of the largest and most brutal migrations in human history. An estimated 12-15 million people were displaced. Roughly 6-7 million Muslims fled to Pakistan (West and East), while a similar number of Hindus and Sikhs fled from Pakistan to India. This migration occurred amidst widespread communal violence, massacres, and abductions.
- **Problems for Pakistan:**
    - **Overwhelming Numbers:** The newly formed government was completely unprepared for the sheer volume of destitute refugees arriving, particularly in Punjab and Sindh (Karachi's population exploded).
    - **Lack of Resources:** There was an acute shortage of food, shelter, sanitation, medical supplies, and administrative personnel to manage the crisis.
    - **Accommodation:** Finding housing for millions was a monumental task. Evacuee properties left by Hindus and Sikhs were insufficient and often required repair. Camps were set up but were inadequate.
    - **Integration:** Integrating the 'Muhajirs' (refugees) into the local population and economy posed significant social and economic challenges.
- **Attempts to Solve:**
    - The government, led by Jinnah, made appeals for calm and assistance.
    - The Quaid-e-Azam Relief Fund was established to collect donations.
    - Ministries for refugees and rehabilitation were created.
    - Voluntary organisations played a significant role.
    - Attempts were made to allocate abandoned properties.
- **Success?** Given the unprecedented scale and the near-total lack of resources, the government's efforts were overwhelmed. While Pakistan _did_ absorb millions of refugees, preventing total societal collapse, the human cost was immense, and the immediate handling was chaotic and insufficient. It was a humanitarian disaster that strained Pakistan's resources to the breaking point. Long-term integration remained a challenge. The "success" lay in survival rather than efficient management.

**6. Economic, Social, and Administrative Problems**

- **Economic Problems:**
    - **Underdeveloped Areas:** Pakistan inherited predominantly agricultural regions with very little industry. Most industrial assets, banks, and businesses had been located in areas that became part of India, or were owned by Hindus/Sikhs who left.
    - **Capital & Expertise:** Lack of capital, technical expertise, and experienced entrepreneurs.
    - **Trade Disruption:** Traditional trade routes were disrupted by the new borders.
    - **Infrastructure:** Limited infrastructure (roads, ports, power). Karachi was the only major port.
    - **Currency & Banking:** Need to establish a new currency and central bank (The State Bank of Pakistan was inaugurated by Jinnah in July 1948).
- **Social Problems:**
    - **National Identity:** Forging a unified national identity among diverse ethnic and linguistic groups (Punjabis, Sindhis, Pashtuns, Balochis, Bengalis) beyond the common factor of Islam.
    - **Regionalism:** Pre-existing regional identities and potential rivalries.
    - **Refugee Integration:** Social tensions between locals and incoming Muhajirs.
    - **Communalism:** Residual communal tensions.
- **Administrative Problems:**
    - **Lack of Personnel:** Severe shortage of experienced Muslim administrators and civil servants, as many senior positions in British India were held by British or Hindus.
    - **Establishing Government:** Setting up a new central government in Karachi from scratch, including ministries, offices, and procedures. Lack of basic resources like office space, furniture, stationery, and typewriters.
    - **Records:** Many official records relevant to Pakistan were left behind in Delhi.
    - **Law and Order:** Establishing control and maintaining law and order amidst the post-partition chaos and refugee influx.
- **Success?** Faced with near-insurmountable odds, Pakistan _did_ manage to establish a functioning central government, create a central bank, and maintain territorial integrity. This administrative survival was a significant achievement. However, the economic base remained fragile, social divisions persisted, and the administrative machinery was weak. The success was foundational but precarious.

**7. Issue of National Language**

- **The Decision:** Pakistan was linguistically diverse. The largest single group was Bengali speakers in East Pakistan. However, Jinnah and the Muslim League leadership, viewing Urdu as a unifying symbol for Muslims across British India and the language of the independence movement, declared Urdu (spoken mainly by Muhajirs and in parts of West Pakistan) as the sole national language. Jinnah reiterated this stance during a visit to Dhaka in March 1948.
- **Problem & Reaction:** This decision caused immediate and widespread resentment in East Pakistan, where Bengali language and culture were deeply cherished. It was seen as an imposition by the West Pakistani elite and disregarded the demographic majority. Protests erupted, laying the seeds for the Bengali Language Movement.
- **Success?** This decision was a significant political misstep. Instead of fostering unity, it created a major grievance and sense of alienation in East Pakistan, contributing directly to the political tensions that eventually led to the secession of Bangladesh in 1971. It was unsuccessful in its aim of unification.

**8. India's Reactions and Ongoing Significance**

- **Skepticism:** Many within the Indian leadership and administration were initially skeptical about Pakistan's viability and expected it to collapse and rejoin India.
- **Actions:** Actions like the delay in transferring assets, the Canal Water Dispute, and the forceful integration of Junagadh and Hyderabad were interpreted by Pakistan as hostile acts aimed at destabilizing the new nation.
- **Kashmir:** India's acceptance of Kashmir's accession and military intervention established a permanent point of conflict.
- **Ongoing Significance:** These initial problems and India's reactions set the stage for decades of mistrust, rivalry, and conflict:
    - **Kashmir:** Remains the core issue, leading to multiple wars (1947-48, 1965, 1999 Kargil War) and ongoing border skirmishes.
    - **Water Disputes:** Though regulated by the Indus Waters Treaty, water remains a sensitive issue.
    - **Arms Race:** Mutual suspicion fuelled a conventional and nuclear arms race.
    - **Ideological Conflict:** Competing national narratives and ideologies (secular India vs. Islamic Pakistan).

**9. Assessment of Jinnah's Role and Achievements as Governor-General (August 1947 - September 1948)**

- **Role:** As Pakistan's first Governor-General and President of the Constituent Assembly, Jinnah was far more than a ceremonial head of state. He was the undisputed leader, the Quaid-e-Azam (Great Leader), and the driving force behind the government during its most critical year.
- **Achievements:**
    - **Symbol of Unity & Hope:** Provided crucial leadership and a unifying presence during a period of existential crisis. His determination gave people hope.
    - **Establishing Governance:** Oversaw the formation of the first cabinet, the establishment of the capital in Karachi, and the beginnings of the administrative structure.
    - **Addressing Crises:** Actively involved in addressing the refugee crisis (setting up relief funds, visiting camps, making appeals). Negotiated with India on assets and canal water disputes.
    - **Setting Policy Direction:** Made key policy speeches outlining his vision for Pakistan (e.g., his August 11, 1947 speech to the Constituent Assembly emphasizing equality of citizens regardless of religion).
    - **Economic Foundation:** Inaugurated the State Bank of Pakistan, a vital step towards economic sovereignty.
    - **Moral Authority:** His personal integrity and authority were instrumental in holding the nascent state together.
- **Challenges/Criticisms:**
    - His declaration of Urdu as the sole national language proved divisive.
    - His failing health limited his stamina in the final months (he suffered from tuberculosis).
    - His death in September 1948 left a leadership vacuum that proved difficult to fill.
    - His dominant role meant institutions were perhaps less developed independently.
- **Overall Importance:** Jinnah's role in the first year was **absolutely critical**. His leadership, prestige, and unwavering determination were arguably the single most important factor in Pakistan's survival through the immense challenges of 1947-48. Without him at the helm, it is highly questionable whether the state would have weathered the storm.

---

**Focus Area Summary:**

- **What immediate problems faced Pakistan?**
    
    - Defining and securing borders (Radcliffe Award fallout).
    - Massive refugee influx and humanitarian crisis.
    - Establishing a functional administration from scratch with limited personnel and resources.
    - Severe economic weakness: lack of industry, capital, and infrastructure.
    - Fair division and receipt of assets (financial and military) from India.
    - Securing water resources (Canal Water Dispute).
    - Integrating Princely States, leading to the Kashmir conflict.
    - Forging national unity among diverse ethnic/linguistic groups.
    - Choosing a national language.
    - Hostile or uncooperative attitude from India on several fronts.
- **How successful were their attempts to solve these problems (1947-48)?**
    
    - **Mixed Success/Survival:** The primary success was _survival_. Pakistan did not collapse. A government was established, a currency created, and basic administration put in place. Refugees were absorbed, albeit with immense suffering.
    - **Failures/Unresolved:** Key issues like the Kashmir dispute became intractable conflicts. The Radcliffe Award's negative consequences couldn't be undone. Asset division remained incomplete. The Canal Water issue was only temporarily patched. The national language decision created long-term division. The refugee crisis left deep scars and integration challenges. Economic vulnerability persisted.
    - Overall: Success was limited and largely confined to establishing the bare minimum required for state survival against overwhelming odds. Many core problems were left unresolved or worsened.
- **How important was the role of Jinnah in solving these problems?**
    
    - **Indispensable.** Jinnah's leadership was paramount. He provided direction, authority, and a symbol of national unity when the state was most fragile. He personally intervened in major crises (refugees, assets, administration setup). His determination was key to navigating the immediate post-partition chaos. While not all his decisions were successful long-term (e.g., language), his presence and leadership were crucial for Pakistan's existence during that critical first year. His death created a significant void.
