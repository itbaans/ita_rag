**Comprehensive Notes: The Development of the Pakistan Movement (Early 20th Century: 1905-1927)**

**Introduction**

The early 20th century marked a crucial phase in the political evolution of Muslims in British India. While the idea of a separate state named "Pakistan" was yet to be formally articulated and adopted, the events between 1905 and 1927 laid the essential groundwork. This period witnessed the rise of distinct Muslim political consciousness, the formation of their primary political organisation (the Muslim League), initial experiments with constitutional reforms, fluctuating periods of cooperation and conflict with the Indian National Congress, and the growing communal divide that would eventually pave the way for the demand for Pakistan.

**1. The Partition of Bengal Controversy (1905–11)**

- **Background:** Bengal, a vast and populous province, was considered administratively unwieldy by the British Raj under Viceroy Lord Curzon.
    
- **The Partition (1905):** The British partitioned Bengal into two provinces:
    
    - **West Bengal:** Hindu-majority, including Bihar and Orissa. Capital: Calcutta.
        
    - **East Bengal and Assam:** Muslim-majority. Capital: Dacca (Dhaka).
        
- **British Rationale:** Officially cited as administrative convenience and efficiency. It was argued that the previous structure neglected the eastern regions.
    
- **Muslim Reaction:** Generally favourable, particularly among the Bengali Muslim elite. They saw the new province of East Bengal and Assam as an opportunity for social, economic, and political advancement, free from the dominance of the Calcutta-based Hindu elite (landlords, merchants, professionals). It offered prospects for increased government jobs, educational opportunities, and political influence.
    
- **Hindu Reaction:** Overwhelmingly negative, especially among the Bengali Hindu elite (the Bhadralok). They viewed it as a deliberate British policy of 'divide and rule' aimed at weakening Bengali nationalism and the Indian National Congress (which had strong roots in Bengal). They felt it split their linguistic and cultural heartland.
    
- **Protests and Swadeshi Movement:** The partition sparked intense agitation, including boycotts of British goods (the Swadeshi movement), promotion of indigenous industries, mass rallies, and even revolutionary activities. Congress strongly backed the anti-partition movement.
    
- **Annulment (1911):** Facing sustained protest and escalating unrest, the British government, under King George V during the Delhi Durbar, annulled the partition and reunified Bengal. Bihar and Orissa were separated into a new province, and Assam became a Chief Commissioner's Province.
    
- **Impact on Muslims:** The annulment was a significant blow to Muslims, especially in East Bengal. They felt betrayed by the British government, who they believed had yielded to Hindu agitation. This reinforced the perception among many Muslims that their interests were distinct and could not be safeguarded solely through reliance on British promises or within the framework of Congress-led nationalism. It strengthened the argument for a separate Muslim political organisation to protect their specific interests.
    

**2. The Simla Deputation (1906)**

- **Context:** With the impending Morley-Minto Reforms promising increased Indian participation in legislative councils, Muslim leaders grew concerned about their representation in an electoral system based on numerical majority, where they would be consistently outnumbered by Hindus.
    
- **The Deputation:** A delegation of 35 prominent Muslim leaders, led by the Aga Khan III, met Viceroy Lord Minto in Simla on October 1, 1906.
    
- **Key Demands:**
    
    - **Separate Electorates:** Muslims should vote exclusively for Muslim candidates in constituencies reserved for them. This was the central demand, aimed at ensuring representation that couldn't be influenced by the Hindu majority vote.
        
    - **Weightage:** Muslims should be granted more seats than their population percentage warranted, particularly in provinces where they were a minority, to reflect their perceived political importance and historical contribution (especially their service in the British Indian Army).
        
    - Representation in government services and judiciary.
        
- **Viceroy Minto's Response:** Minto was sympathetic to the demands. He acknowledged the concerns of the Muslim community and assured them that their political rights and interests as a distinct community would be safeguarded in the upcoming reforms.
    
- **Significance:**
    
    - It marked the first formal collective effort by Muslim leaders to articulate their political demands directly to the highest level of British authority in India.
        
    - It laid the groundwork for the acceptance of separate electorates in the Morley-Minto Reforms.
        
    - It boosted the morale of Muslims seeking a separate political identity and provided momentum for the creation of a dedicated Muslim political party.
        
    - Critics argue it was encouraged, or at least welcomed, by the British as part of the 'divide and rule' strategy, further separating Muslims from the mainstream nationalist movement led by Congress.
        

**3. Establishment of the All-India Muslim League (1906) and its Aims**

- **Reasons for Establishment:**
    
    - **Need for a Political Platform:** The Simla Deputation highlighted the need for a permanent political body to represent Muslim interests consistently.
        
    - **Partition of Bengal Aftermath:** The Hindu agitation against the partition and the perceived vulnerability of Muslim interests underscored the necessity of organised political action.
        
    - **Fear of Hindu Majority:** Growing concerns about being submerged by the Hindu majority in any future democratic setup.
        
    - **Congress's Perceived Bias:** Many Muslim leaders felt that the Indian National Congress primarily represented Hindu interests and aspirations, despite its claims of being a secular, national body.
        
    - **Encouragement from Simla Deputation Success:** The positive reception from Viceroy Minto emboldened leaders to form a party.
        
- **Creation (December 1906):** Founded during the annual meeting of the Muhammadan Educational Conference in Dacca (Dhaka). Nawab Salimullah Khan of Dacca played a key role, proposing the formation of the party. Other prominent founders included Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk and Mohsin-ul-Mulk. The Aga Khan was its first honorary president.
    
- **Initial Aims (as outlined in the "Green Book"):**
    
    1. **Promote Loyalty:** To foster loyalty among Indian Muslims towards the British Government and remove any misconceptions about government actions.
        
    2. **Protect and Advance Muslim Rights:** To safeguard and advance the political rights and interests of Muslims in India and respectfully represent their needs and aspirations to the government.
        
    3. **Prevent Inter-Communal Hostility:** To prevent the rise of feelings of hostility between Muslims and other communities without prejudice to the other objectives of the League.
        
- **Early Character:** Initially, the League was dominated by landlords and aristocrats, was relatively conservative, and emphasized loyalty to the British Crown while seeking protection for Muslim interests within the colonial framework. It was not initially demanding separation or independence.
    

**4. The Morley-Minto Reforms (Indian Councils Act, 1909)**

- **Context:** Introduced by John Morley (Secretary of State for India) and Lord Minto (Viceroy) in response to growing nationalist demands and the specific demands raised by groups like the Simla Deputation.
    
- **Key Provisions:**
    
    - **Increased Size of Legislative Councils:** Both central and provincial legislative councils were enlarged.
        
    - **Increased Non-Official Majority (Provincial):** Provincial councils were allowed a majority of non-official members (though some were still nominated, not elected). The central council retained an official majority.
        
    - **Separate Electorates:** The Act formally granted separate electorates for Muslims in provincial council elections, as demanded by the Simla Deputation. Muslims could now vote for Muslim candidates in reserved seats.
        
    - **Limited Powers:** The councils had advisory powers; they could discuss budgets, propose resolutions, and ask questions, but had no real control over administration or finance. The executive remained firmly in British hands.
        
- **Impact and Significance:**
    
    - **Constitutional Recognition of Muslims:** Granting separate electorates gave constitutional recognition to the idea that Indian Muslims formed a distinct political community with unique interests separate from Hindus. This is considered a landmark step in the formalisation of communal politics in India.
        
    - **Muslim League's Achievement:** Seen as a major early success for the Muslim League, validating its existence and strategy.
        
    - **Congress Reaction:** Congress officially condemned separate electorates, arguing they were undemocratic and detrimental to the development of a united Indian nation. However, some Congress members still participated in the reformed councils.
        
    - **Limited Self-Government:** While increasing Indian participation, the reforms fell far short of granting meaningful self-government or parliamentary democracy. Power remained concentrated with the British executive.
        

**5. Impact of the First World War (1914-1918) on the Subcontinent**

- **Indian Support for Britain:** India contributed significantly to the British war effort in terms of troops (over a million soldiers served overseas) and resources. Mainstream political organisations, including Congress and the Muslim League, largely supported the war effort, hoping for political concessions in return.
    
- **Economic Hardship:** The war led to increased taxes, inflation, shortages of goods, and economic distress for ordinary Indians, fuelling discontent.
    
- **Rise in Nationalist Expectations:** British wartime propaganda emphasizing democracy and self-determination (especially President Wilson's Fourteen Points) raised expectations among Indians for greater self-rule after the war.
    
- **The Khilafat Issue:** Turkey (Ottoman Empire), whose Sultan was also considered the Caliph (Khalifa, spiritual head) by many Sunni Muslims worldwide, joined the war against Britain. This placed Indian Muslims in a difficult position. They feared for the future of the Caliphate and the Ottoman Empire after the war, leading to the rise of the Khilafat Movement. This issue would become a major rallying point for Muslim political activity post-war.
    
- **Increased Political Activity:** Despite wartime restrictions (like the Defence of India Act, 1915), the war period saw continued political discussions and negotiations, leading to developments like the Lucknow Pact.
    

**6. Co-operation of the Muslim League with Congress and the Lucknow Pact (1916)**

- **Reasons for Cooperation:**
    
    - **Shared Goal of Self-Government:** Both Congress and the League desired greater autonomy and constitutional reforms from the British.
        
    - **Annulment of Bengal Partition:** This had disillusioned Muslims about British reliability and pushed the League towards greater cooperation with Congress.
        
    - **Younger, Nationalist Leaders:** A new generation of leaders emerged in the League (like Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was a member of both Congress and the League at this time) who were more nationalist and favoured joint action.
        
    - **British Policies:** Wartime measures and the lack of significant political concessions fostered a common sense of grievance.
        
    - **Khilafat Concern:** The brewing concern over the fate of the Ottoman Caliphate also encouraged Muslims to seek alliances.
        
- **The Lucknow Pact (December 1916):** An agreement reached at the joint sessions of the Congress and the Muslim League in Lucknow.
    
    - **Key Terms:**
        
        - **Congress Acceptance of Separate Electorates:** Congress agreed, for the first time, to the principle of separate electorates for Muslims in provincial councils.
            
        - **Weightage:** Agreed upon system of 'weightage' – Muslims got representation exceeding their population share in provinces where they were a minority (e.g., United Provinces), while getting less than their population share in Muslim-majority provinces (Punjab, Bengal).
            
        - **Joint Demand for Reforms:** Both parties jointly demanded further constitutional reforms, including a larger share of elected seats in councils and greater powers for the legislatures (dominion status as a long-term goal).
            
        - **Minority Protection:** A provision stated that no bill or resolution concerning a community could be passed in any council if three-fourths of the representatives of that community opposed it.
            
- **Significance:**
    
    - **High Point of Hindu-Muslim Unity:** Represented a remarkable (though temporary) convergence of the two major political organisations.
        
    - **Strengthened Bargaining Position:** Presented a united front to the British, strengthening the demand for reforms.
        
    - **Legitimisation of League:** Congress's acceptance of separate electorates significantly boosted the Muslim League's legitimacy as the representative voice of Muslim interests.
        
    - **Seeds of Future Conflict?** While promoting unity then, the acceptance of separate electorates and weightage (especially the reduction in Muslim representation in Punjab and Bengal) would later become contentious issues.
        

**7. The Rowlatt Act (1919) and the Amritsar Massacre (1919)**

- **Context:** Post-WWI, instead of granting expected reforms, the British imposed repressive measures to curb nationalist activities, fearing unrest.
    
- **The Rowlatt Act (Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act, 1919):** Based on the recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee, this Act allowed the government to imprison suspected revolutionaries without trial for up to two years. It severely curtailed civil liberties like freedom of the press and assembly.
    
- **Indian Reaction:** Met with universal condemnation from Indian leaders across the political spectrum, including Gandhi, Jinnah, and others. Seen as a betrayal of wartime support. Jinnah resigned from the Imperial Legislative Council in protest. Gandhi called for a nationwide hartal (strike) and launched his first major nationwide Satyagraha campaign.
    
- **The Amritsar Massacre (Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, April 13, 1919):**
    
    - **Background:** Protests against the Rowlatt Act were intense in Punjab. The government imposed martial law in Amritsar, banning public gatherings. Two popular leaders, Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal, were arrested.
        
    - **The Event:** A large, peaceful crowd gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh (an enclosed public space with few narrow exits) for a Baisakhi festival meeting and to protest the arrests. Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer arrived with troops, blocked the main exit, and ordered his soldiers to fire into the unarmed crowd without warning. Firing continued for about 10 minutes until ammunition was nearly exhausted.
        
    - **Casualties:** Official British figures cited 379 dead and over 1,200 wounded, but Indian estimates were much higher.
        
- **Impact:**
    
    - **Shock and Outrage:** Sent shockwaves across India and destroyed any remaining faith in British justice and fairness among many Indians.
        
    - **Boost to Nationalism:** Galvanised the independence movement, turning many moderates into staunch nationalists.
        
    - **Gandhi's Rise:** Further solidified Mahatma Gandhi's position as a central leader, leading him to launch the Non-Cooperation Movement.
        
    - **Loss of British Moral Authority:** Widely condemned internationally and within Britain itself (though Dyer also had supporters), damaging Britain's image as a benevolent ruler.
        

**8. The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms (Government of India Act, 1919)**

- **Context:** Based on the Montagu-Chelmsford Report (1918), formulated by Edwin Montagu (Secretary of State) and Lord Chelmsford (Viceroy). Intended as the next step in introducing responsible government, partly fulfilling wartime promises but also shaped by the need to manage growing nationalism.
    
- **Key Provisions:**
    
    - **Dyarchy in Provinces:** Introduced a dual system of government in the provinces. Provincial subjects were divided into 'Reserved' (controlled by the Governor and his executive council, e.g., police, justice, finance) and 'Transferred' (administered by Indian ministers responsible to the provincial legislative council, e.g., education, health, agriculture). The Governor retained ultimate control and veto power.
        
    - **Enlarged Legislatures:** Both central and provincial legislative councils were further enlarged, with a greater proportion of elected members.
        
    - **Bicameral Legislature at Centre:** Created a two-house central legislature (Council of State and Legislative Assembly).
        
    - **Extension of Franchise:** Voting rights were extended, but still limited by property, tax, or educational qualifications (covering about 10% of the adult male population).
        
    - **Separate Electorates Retained:** Continued the system of separate electorates for Muslims and extended it to other minorities (Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans).
        
- **Reception and Impact:**
    
    - **"Too Little, Too Late":** Widely regarded as inadequate by Indian nationalists. Congress condemned it as "disappointing and unsatisfactory." The system of dyarchy was complex and often unworkable, with ministers lacking real power over finance or administration.
        
    - **Limited Power Transfer:** Real power remained firmly in British hands, especially at the Centre and through the Governor's overriding powers in the provinces.
        
    - **Further Division:** The extension of separate electorates to other groups was seen by nationalists as further entrenching communal divisions.
        
    - **Basis for Future Governance:** Despite its flaws, the Act provided the framework for provincial government until 1935 and gave Indians some experience (albeit limited) in administration and legislative processes.
        

**9. The Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)**

- **Leaders:** Primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi, with strong support from the Ali Brothers (Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali) who led the Khilafat Movement.
    
- **Causes:** Launched in response to:
    
    1. **The Rowlatt Act:** Repression and denial of civil liberties.
        
    2. **The Amritsar Massacre:** Injustice and brutality.
        
    3. **The Khilafat Issue:** The harsh terms imposed on the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Sèvres (1920) angered Indian Muslims who felt Britain had broken its promises to protect the Caliphate. Gandhi saw the Khilafat cause as an opportunity to unite Hindus and Muslims against British rule.
        
- **Methods (Non-violent Non-cooperation):**
    
    - Boycott of government schools, colleges, courts, and legislative councils.
        
    - Boycott of foreign goods, promotion of Swadeshi (especially Khadi - homespun cloth).
        
    - Surrender of titles and honours awarded by the British.
        
    - Resignation from government service.
        
    - Mass rallies, strikes (hartals), and civil disobedience.
        
- **Hindu-Muslim Unity:** The movement saw unprecedented Hindu-Muslim unity, with Congress and the Khilafat Committee working closely together. Gandhi and the Ali Brothers toured the country jointly.
    
- **Withdrawal (February 1922):** Gandhi abruptly called off the movement after the Chauri Chaura incident, where protestors attacked a police station and killed 22 policemen. Gandhi felt the movement had turned violent and people were not ready for disciplined non-violent resistance.
    
- **Impact:**
    
    - **Mass Mobilisation:** Brought the nationalist movement to the masses, transforming it from an elite affair.
        
    - **Demonstrated Power of Non-Violence:** Showcased the potential of non-violent mass struggle.
        
    - **Temporary Unity:** Achieved remarkable Hindu-Muslim unity, though its foundation (the Khilafat issue) was external to purely Indian concerns.
        
    - **Muslim Alienation:** The abrupt withdrawal without consulting Khilafat leaders disillusioned many Muslims. The subsequent abolition of the Caliphate by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in Turkey (1924) rendered the Khilafat movement irrelevant, removing the main plank of recent Hindu-Muslim cooperation.
        

**10. Breakdown of Congress-Muslim League Cooperation & Growth of Communalism**

- **Post-Non-Cooperation/Khilafat:** The collapse of these movements led to disillusionment and the resurgence of communal tensions.
    
    - **Muslim Disillusionment:** Many Muslims felt let down by Gandhi's withdrawal of NCM and the eventual irrelevance of the Khilafat issue. Some felt Congress had used the Khilafat issue for its own ends.
        
    - **End of a Common Cause:** The unifying factor against the British weakened.
        
- **Resurgence of Communalism:** The mid-1920s saw a significant increase in communal friction and riots across India.
    
    - **Revivalist Movements:** Hindu movements like Shuddhi (re-conversion to Hinduism) and Sangathan (organisation for self-defence) gained traction, often perceived as targeting Muslims. In response, Muslim movements like Tabligh (preaching) and Tanzim (organisation) emerged.
        
    - **Music Before Mosques & Cow Slaughter:** Disputes over traditional issues like playing music near mosques during prayer times and cow slaughter flared up.
        
    - **Competition for Resources:** Political reforms, however limited, increased competition for seats in councils, government jobs, and educational opportunities, often along communal lines.
        
    - **Political Exploitation:** Politicians on both sides sometimes exploited communal feelings for political gain.
        
- **Diverging Paths:** The Muslim League, weakened after the Khilafat movement, began to reorganise, focusing more exclusively on safeguarding Muslim interests. Congress also faced internal divisions.
    

**11. Growing Divisions in the Congress Party**

- **Post-Non-Cooperation Split:** After Gandhi's withdrawal of the NCM and his subsequent imprisonment, Congress split into two factions:
    
    - **Swarajists (Pro-Changers):** Led by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru. They advocated entering the legislative councils (created by the 1919 Act) to obstruct government work from within ("wrecking the reforms from within").
        
    - **No-Changers:** Led by C. Rajagopalachari, Vallabhbhai Patel, and Rajendra Prasad. They adhered strictly to Gandhi's constructive programme (spinning Khadi, promoting Hindu-Muslim unity, removing untouchability) and favoured boycotting the councils.
        
- **Compromise and Continued Differences:** Although a compromise allowed the Swarajists to contest elections in 1923, underlying differences in strategy persisted, sometimes weakening the party's united front. These internal debates often overshadowed efforts to maintain broad coalitions, including with Muslim groups.
    

**12. The Delhi Proposals (1927)**

- **Context:** In the face of rising communalism and anticipating the next round of constitutional reforms (the Simon Commission was announced later in 1927), Muhammad Ali Jinnah and other Muslim leaders sought a basis for future Hindu-Muslim cooperation within a united India framework.
    
- **The Proposals:** A group of prominent Muslim leaders met in Delhi in March 1927 and proposed a formula to Congress for Muslim cooperation:
    
    - They offered to give up the demand for **separate electorates** (a major concession).
        
    - **In return**, they demanded:
        
        1. Separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency to create a Muslim-majority province.
            
        2. Introduction of constitutional reforms in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Balochistan on the same footing as other provinces (making them Muslim-majority provinces with more autonomy).
            
        3. Reservation of **one-third** of the seats for Muslims in the Central Legislature.
            
        4. Reservation of seats for Muslims in Punjab and Bengal proportionate to their population.
            
- **Significance:**
    
    - **Major Attempt at Compromise:** Represented a significant effort by influential Muslim leaders, led by Jinnah, to find common ground with Congress and abandon the contentious separate electorates in favour of joint electorates under specific conditions.
        
    - **Potential Turning Point:** If accepted wholeheartedly by Congress, it might have changed the course of Hindu-Muslim relations.
        
- **Congress Response and Aftermath:** Congress initially welcomed the proposals at its Bombay session (May 1927) but later equivocated. The subsequent Nehru Report (1928), prepared by a committee led by Motilal Nehru in response to the Simon Commission challenge, rejected several key aspects of the Delhi Proposals (particularly the one-third central legislature reservation and reservations in Punjab/Bengal proportionate to population). This rejection deeply alienated Jinnah and many other Muslim leaders, marking a critical breakdown in trust and cooperation, often referred to by Jinnah as the "parting of the ways."

**Focus Area Summaries:**

**1. What were the aims and origins of the Muslim League?**

- **Origins:** The Muslim League emerged from a growing sense of political vulnerability and distinct identity among Indian Muslims in the early 20th century. Key contributing factors included:
    
    - The legacy of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, who had advocated for Muslim education and loyalty to the British while expressing concerns about representative democracy in India.
        
    - Fear of Hindu majority dominance in elected bodies.
        
    - The perception that Congress primarily represented Hindu interests.
        
    - The controversy surrounding the Partition of Bengal (1905) and its subsequent annulment (1911), which suggested Muslim interests were precarious.
        
    - The success of the Simla Deputation (1906) in securing sympathy for separate representation.
        
- **Aims (at its founding in 1906):** The initial aims were relatively moderate and focused on operating within the British framework:
    
    - To foster loyalty to the British government.
        
    - To protect and advance the political rights and interests of Muslims in India.
        
    - To represent Muslim needs and aspirations to the government.
        
    - To prevent hostility between Muslims and other communities.
        
    - Crucially, its early aims did not include demanding a separate state or independence from Britain. The primary goal was to secure recognition and safeguards for Muslims as a distinct community within British India.
        

**2. How successful was British rule and attempts at constitutional reform during the years 1909–19?**

British rule and constitutional reforms (Morley-Minto 1909, Montagu-Chelmsford 1919) during this period had mixed and ultimately limited success:

- **Partial Successes:**
    
    - **Increased Indian Participation:** The reforms did increase the number of Indians in legislative councils and introduced the principle (however flawed) of ministerial responsibility in provinces (Dyarchy under Mont-Ford).
        
    - **Recognition of Muslim Concerns:** By granting separate electorates (Morley-Minto), the British acknowledged and addressed the specific demands of a significant section of the Muslim leadership, temporarily securing their loyalty and cooperation. This was seen as a success by the Muslim League.
        
    - **Maintaining Control:** From a purely British perspective, the reforms allowed some political ventilation while ensuring ultimate British control remained intact through reserved powers, official majorities (initially at the Centre), and the Governor's veto.
        
- **Failures and Limitations:**
    
    - **Inadequate Power Transfer:** The reforms failed to satisfy the growing demands for meaningful self-government (Swaraj) from Indian nationalists (both Congress and increasingly the League). Dyarchy was widely seen as unworkable and frustrating.
        
    - **Entrenching Divisions:** The introduction and continuation of separate electorates, while satisfying some Muslim leaders, was heavily criticized by Congress for hindering national unity and promoting communal politics.
        
    - **Repression Alongside Reform:** The period saw repressive measures like the Rowlatt Act alongside reforms, undermining the goodwill potentially generated by the constitutional changes. The Amritsar Massacre destroyed faith in British intentions.
        
    - **Failure to Prevent Agitation:** The reforms ultimately failed to stem the tide of nationalism or prevent mass movements like the Non-Cooperation/Khilafat campaigns.
        
- **Overall Assessment:** The reforms were incremental steps that conceded limited participation but fundamentally failed to meet Indian political aspirations. They were more successful in managing dissent in the short term and arguably deepened communal divisions than in laying a stable foundation for future self-government that satisfied all major communities.
    

**3. How and why did relationships between Muslims and Hindus change between 1916 and 1927?**

Relationships between Muslims and Hindus underwent significant fluctuation during this period, moving from unprecedented cooperation to increasing distance and mistrust.

- **How Relationships Changed:**
    
    - **High Point of Unity (1916 - c. 1922):** The Lucknow Pact (1916) symbolized cooperation, with Congress accepting separate electorates and both parties jointly demanding reforms. This unity peaked during the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation Movements (1920-22), where Hindus and Muslims jointly protested against British policies under the leadership of Gandhi and the Ali Brothers. There was widespread fraternisation and joint political action.
        
    - **Breakdown of Unity (c. 1922 - 1924):** Unity began to fray with Gandhi's unilateral withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation Movement after Chauri Chaura (1922), which disillusioned many Muslims. The abolition of the Caliphate in Turkey (1924) removed the central plank (Khilafat) that had cemented the alliance, leaving a vacuum.
        
    - **Growing Communalism (Mid-1920s):** The period saw a sharp rise in communal tensions, marked by riots, revivalist movements (Shuddhi, Sangathan, Tabligh, Tanzim), and disputes over issues like music before mosques and cow slaughter. Political discourse became increasingly communal.
        
    - **Political Divergence (c. 1927):** Attempts to bridge the gap, like the Delhi Proposals (1927), showed that significant differences remained over power-sharing, representation, and constitutional safeguards. The subsequent failure to agree on these proposals (especially after the Nehru Report in 1928) marked a major setback for united action.
        
- **Why Relationships Changed:**
    
    - **Temporary Nature of Unifying Factors:** The unity achieved was largely based on shared opposition to specific British policies (Rowlatt Act, Amritsar) and the emotional Khilafat issue. Once these immediate causes subsided or were resolved (Khilafat abolished), the underlying differences re-emerged.
        
    - **Collapse of Khilafat:** The end of the Khilafat movement removed the primary platform for joint Hindu-Muslim action.
        
    - **Political Competition:** Constitutional reforms, even limited ones, intensified competition for political power, jobs, and resources, often channeled along communal lines.
        
    - **Communal Organisation and Propaganda:** The rise of communal and revivalist organisations on both sides actively fostered separate identities and sometimes stoked mutual suspicion and hostility.
        
    - **Differing Political Priorities:** As the prospect of future reforms grew, specific community interests regarding representation (separate vs. joint electorates, weightage, provincial autonomy vs. strong centre) came to the forefront, leading to disagreements.
        
    - **Leadership Actions and Perceptions:** Actions like Gandhi's withdrawal of NCM were perceived differently by communities. The failure of leaders to agree on power-sharing formulas (like the response to Delhi Proposals/Nehru Report) eroded trust.

**Conclusion**

By 1927, the foundations for a distinct Muslim political trajectory, which would eventually lead to the demand for Pakistan, were firmly established. The Muslim League had emerged as the primary (though not yet sole) voice for Muslim political interests. The principle of separate electorates had been conceded by the British and even temporarily accepted by Congress, constitutionally recognizing Muslims as a separate political entity. Periods of cooperation with Congress had proved fragile, giving way to growing communal tensions and political divergence. While the concrete demand for a separate state was still over a decade away, the experiences, political developments, and growing communal divide between 1905 and 1927 created the necessary conditions and consciousness for the Pakistan Movement to gain momentum in the subsequent decades. The failure of attempts like the Delhi Proposals signalled the increasing difficulty of finding a power-sharing arrangement acceptable to both major communities within a united Indian framework.
