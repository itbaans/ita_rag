Introduction

Situated in the northwest corner of the Indian subcontinent, the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan occupies a position of historic impor-

tance. Its strategic location, its role in the birth of civilization, and its 
influence as a crossroads of political and religious ideologies have kept 
it at the forefront of world events. Geographically, present-day Pakistan 
has long been a gateway between Eurasia and the subcontinent and 
between East and West. Its culture and history have been enriched by 
the countless invaders, traders, and settlers who have been a part of 
the region’s past. Some, like Alexander the Great and his army, merely 
passed through but left a lasting mark. Others, such as the Arab armies 
spreading the word of Islam and the British who imposed the ways of 
the West, became an integral part of the region’s culture and character. 
Some of humankind’s greatest works of art and architecture, of verse 
and word, were created here. Today the region again has taken an 
outsized role on the world stage: It is a linchpin in the global struggle 
against terrorism, a cauldron in the heated conflict between secular and 
theocratic rule, a poster nation for the struggle between autocracy and 
democracy, and a nuclear power whose relations with its neighbor India 
have made this one of the most unstable regions in the world.

Most Westerners know little about this region or nation. Though an 
independent state only since 1947, its homeland has a history unique 
from the rest of the subcontinent it shares with India. Here the Indus 
Valley Civilization, one of the world’s earliest and greatest, flourished 
contemporaneously with the Egyptian and Mesopotamian empires. The 
region has also been a cradle of spiritual awakening. Here Hinduism was 
born in the aftermath of the Aryan migration into the region that began 
about 1700–1500 B.C.E. A scant distance away, the Buddha received 
enlightenment, founding a religion and philosophy that transformed 
the region. Islam, which would have an even greater impact, gained its 
foothold in Asia in what is today Pakistan. And the Sikh religion can 
trace its roots to the region as well.

One of the most fabled dynasties in history, the Mughals, a regime so 
rich and powerful that today its name is synonymous with those attri-
butes, ruled from here, as over the years have robber princes, religious 
zealots, and ruthless vagabonds. During the British occupation, what

is now Pakistan became a principal theater in the Great Game played 
by the West against Russia for regional dominance. Pakistan’s role as 
geopolitical fulcrum grew after independence, alternately aligning itself 
with the East, the West, and as an independent in its foreign policy. It 
often stood by the United States as an important ally during the cold 
war. It was from here in 1960 that the U-2 spy plane shot down by the 
Soviet Union took off. Pakistan also helped turn Afghanistan into the 
Soviet Union’s Vietnam after their occupation in the 1980s. In the new 
century it has become a major battleground in a new global struggle, 
pitting terrorism fueled by radical Islam against progressive and secular 
social forces.

Politically and economically, Pakistan has had a troubled domestic 
history. Periods of civilian rule marked by corruption and political grid-
lock have alternated with years of military dictatorships. Financially 
stunted at birth, Pakistan has seen improvements in the economy since, 
which though impressive, have still left the vast majority of its citizens 
living in poverty. And the dilemma over the role of Islam in government 
and society continues to stoke contention.

Today these issues have again brought Pakistan to a crossroads. 
How it resolves these dilemmas will have repercussions far beyond the 
nation’s own borders. The goal in this work is twofold: to provide an 
accessible account of the people and events that have shaped what is 
now Pakistan, and to provide a foundation of understanding so readers 
can be better informed in considering the next chapter of its history.

THE LAND AND ITS 

EARLY HISTORY

Few nations have as rich or complex a history as the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan. Its destiny has been shaped first by its geography. The 

violent collision of continents that formed this land threw up great 
mountains that made this corner of the subcontinent a place apart. The 
sequestered, fertile environment of the Indus Valley nurtured one of the 
world’s first great civilizations. Yet the passes that breached the guard-
ing massifs served as funnels through which invaders both hostile and 
friendly have poured for millennia. These outsiders have been the sec-
ond great ingredient in Pakistan’s destiny. They brought their traditions, 
ideas, and ways of life, all of which have become part of the nation’s 
identity. This chapter surveys the nation’s physical landscape, its first 
civilizations, and the provinces that today reflect the historical divisions 
that have made Pakistan’s past and present so vibrant, dynamic, and 
tumultuous. The chapter also introduces the Aryans, the first of the 
interloping groups that would shape the history and heritage of what 
is today Pakistan. The Aryans’ experiences here would give rise to the 
Hindu religion, which continues to be a force with a powerful effect on 
the region today.

Geology and Geography
Before the continents as we know them came to be, the land that is 
now Pakistan and India were part of Gondwanaland, an ancient super-
continent. Some 200 million years ago Gondwanaland began to break 
apart, torn by tectonic forces. Over time the supercontinent’s rem-
nants formed landmasses including Africa, South America, Antarctica, 
Australia, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Deccan Plateau, or the 
Indian subcontinent. At the time the Eurasian landmass was separated 
from the disintegrating supercontinent by a long, shallow sea. The

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

streams and rivers that drained what we know now as Asia deposited 
sandy runoff into this basin while the calcified remains of sea creatures 
likewise accreted. Over time these deposits became sandstone and 
limestone. After Gondwanaland splintered, the future Deccan Plateau 
moved north, toward Eurasia. As the two landmasses drove toward 
each other, the sandstone and limestone that had carpeted the sea 
floor between them was thrust upward. At least 45 million years ago 
the landmasses met.

The submarine deposits ultimately became the fold mountains that 
now form a ridge across southern Asia from the Mediterranean to the 
Pacific. The contorted, visible bowing of the sedimentary rocks from 
which the mountains formed bears evidence of the compression caused 
by the slow tectonic collision. The peaks reach their highest point at 
the north end of the subcontinent. These are the Himalayan Mountains. 
Marine fossils found on Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak, attest 
to its undersea ancestry. The Himalayas and its offshoots, which flank 
southward on the east and west sides of the subcontinent, have served 
as a natural barrier to both the elements and humanity, separating 
the lands that became Pakistan and India from the rest of Asia. By 11 
million B.C.E. migration of animals from and to the subcontinent had 
ended.

Topography
To its south, west, north, and northeast, natural barriers of mountain 
and sea have sheltered Pakistan. But to the southeast, the land spills 
out into the Deccan, the vast peninsular homeland of India. The Indus 
River, historically the lifeblood of what would become Pakistan, and its 
tributaries drain the plateau. Though its terrain is varied throughout the 
country, Pakistan can be divided into three basic geographic areas: the 
northern highlands, the Baluchistan Plateau, and the Indus River plain. 
These areas can be further segmented into the Salt Mountains and the 
Potwar Plateau, north of the Indus Plain; the Western Mountain region 
(composed of the mountains in western Baluchistan); and the Upper 
and Lower Indus River Plain (roughly corresponding with the present-
day provinces of Punjab and Sind, respectively).

The Arabian Sea forms Pakistan’s southern border. Its western border 
is shared with Iran in the south and Afghanistan in the north. Along 
Pakistan’s northern border the slim arm of Afghanistan’s Wakhan region 
separates Pakistan from Tajikistan. China’s territories of Xinjiang and 
Tibet lie on Kashmir’s border to the north and east. To Pakistan’s east

THE LAND AND ITS EARLY HISTORY

THE INDUS RIVER

The Indus River is Pakistan’s principal waterway. Known as the 
Sindhu in Sanskrit, the Sinthos in Greek, and the Sindus in Latin, 

it has been integral to Pakistan’s culture and history, yet paradoxically 
gave its name to India, Pakistan’s neighbor and rival. Its headwaters are 
in the Himalayas in Tibet. It fl ows northwest through Gilgit-Baltistan 
in Kashmir before turning south and traversing the length of Pakistan, 
its total length between 1,800 and 2,000 miles (2,900–3,200 km). The 
river gave birth to one of the world’s fi rst great civilizations, the Indus 
Valley Civilization. The course of the river has changed since ancient 
times as a result, it is believed, of earthquakes and other shifts of the 
land. Today it is damned at Tarbela, at the foothills of the Himalayas 
between Peshawar and Rawalpindi. Shortly after Pakistan became 
independent in 1947, India, which was given the region with the river’s 
headwaters by the British, shut the fl ow of water to the Indus, creat-
ing a grave crisis that took more than 15 years to resolve.

region’s history and culture. (Courtesy Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation)

are the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan. The Thar Desert serves as 
a barrier between these Indian lands and Pakistan. Despite the absence 
of any other barriers between these two states, historically they devel-
oped independently.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

The Himalayas
The Himalayas (meaning “the abode of snow” in Sanskrit) extend in 
a long bow some 1,500 miles (2,400 km) across the north end of the 
subcontinent, from the Indus River in the west to the Brahmaputra River 
(which originates in Tibet and ends in the Bay of Bengal) in the east. Four 
major ranges comprise the Himalayas: The Outermost, or Sub-Himalayas, 
are the farthest south. Its low hills, known as the Siwaliks, rise to about 
3,000 feet (914 m). To the north lie the Outer, or Lesser Himalayas, 
whose peaks average 14,000–15,000 feet (4,267–4,572 m). Behind the 
Pir Panjal Range of the Outer Himalayas rise the Central, or Great Snowy 
Himalayas. In the Karakoram Range, permanently snow-covered peaks 
average 20,000 feet (6,096 m) in height and include Mount Everest, the 
world’s loftiest peak (29,028 feet; 8,848 m), and in Pakistan-controlled

Tourism Development Corporation)

Kashmir, K2, the world’s second highest peak (28,251 feet; 8,611 m). 
North of Pakistan’s border is the Ladakh Range, or Inner Himalayas.

In Pakistan’s northwest is the Hindu Kush (Hindu Killer) Range, 
extending from the high plateau of Pamir, sometimes called the Roof 
of the World, into Afghanistan. Tirich Mir is its highest peak (25,289 
ft.; 7,708 m).

The Himalayas have had important historical and climatological 
effects on Pakistan and the entire subcontinent. They capture mois-
ture-laden winds from the Arabian Sea (and to the east, the Bay of 
Bengal) and create rain that irrigates the region. In winter they block 
cold winds from North and Central Asia, keeping the subcontinent’s 
climate mild. Spring melt-offs provide water. Historically the Himalayas 
and contiguous ranges have also formed a barrier protecting the region 
from the incursions of outsiders. Several passes along Pakistan’s west-
ern and northern borders provide routes in and out of the nation and 
have been key transit points throughout recorded history.

Western Mountains
In Baluchistan, west of the Indus Plain, three minor ranges run parallel 
south from the Hindu Kush to the Kabul River, their valleys draining 
the Swat, the Panjikora, and the Chitral-Kunar Rivers.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

The Safed Koh Range, which runs east–west, has peaks averag-
ing about 12,000 feet (3,657 m). The Khyber Pass, the most famous 
of the high-elevation gateways to the subcontinent, cuts through its 
mountains. About 33 miles (53 km) in length, the pass extends from 
Jamrud, some 10 miles (16 km) from Peshawar, Pakistan, to Dakka 
in Afghanistan. South of the range is the Kurram River. The Kurram 
Pass, which goes through Parachinar, Thal, and Kohat, has long been 
another favored route to Afghanistan. To the south, the Waziristan 
Hills lie between the Kurram and Gomal Rivers. The Gomal Pass, 
named for the Gomal River, which feeds into the Indus, has been an 
important trade route between Afghanistan and Pakistan for nomadic 
tribes known as the Powindahs. (Today their entry into Pakistan is 
restricted.)

South of the Gomal River the Sulaiman Mountains extend for 300 
miles (483 km). The main peak, Takht-i-Sulaiman, is 11,100 feet (3,383 
m). The Bolan Pass is the most noted transit point of these mountains 
and the Bolan their main river. The Pakistan city of Quetta guards the 
northern end of the pass. From here the land descends to the Kirthar 
Hills, low parallel ranges of some 7,000 feet (2,134 m) in elevation. 
They get little monsoon rainfall and are barren.

West of the Sulaiman and Kirthar Mountains the land descends to 
the dry hills of the Baluchistan Plateau, running northeast to southwest 
at an elevation of about 1,000 feet (305 m). The coastal Makran range 
borders the south end of Pakistan’s western boundary.

The Salt Range and the Potwar Plateau
The Salt Range extends from near Jhelum, on the Jhelum River, north-
west to the Indus River and then south into the districts of Bannu and 
Dera Ismail Khan in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). Its 
peaks average 2,200 feet (671 m) in height, though they reach about 
5,000 feet (1,524 m) near Sakesar. In addition to extensive deposits of 
salt, its steep rock faces in the north contain gypsum, coal, and other 
minerals. The Salt Range has also attracted the attention of geologists, 
as it contains one of the world’s most complete geological sequences, 
from the Cambrian to the Pleistocene eras.

The Potwar Plateau extends north of the Salt Range. The elevation 
ranges from 1,000 to 2,000 feet (305–610 m). The landscape is varied, 
shaped by glacial erosion. During the last ice ages glaciers that covered 
Kashmir and much of the northern subcontinent extended over this 
now semiarid region, creating the plateau’s hills and hillocks.

THE LAND AND ITS EARLY HISTORY

The Indus Plain
South of the Salt Range the vast Indus Plain, drained by the Indus 
River and its tributaries, stretches to the Arabian Sea. The plain is 
composed of fertile alluvial deposits left by the overflow of the rivers. 
Several rivers in addition to the Indus traverse the Himalayan ranges. 
Their enormous flows in the rainy season often flood the surrounding 
plains. The northern part is called the Punjab and gives its name to the 
province that occupies the land. Most of this area is in Pakistan. The 
elevation here ranges from 600 to 1,000 feet (183–305 m).

The land between two rivers is referred to as a doab. The Indus has 
five major tributaries, and thus Punjab has four doabs. The combined 
waters of these tributaries, before joining the Indus near Mithankot, 
is called the Panjad (five rivers), thus the name of the province. The 
Indus and its five major tributaries join in Sind south of Mithankot. 
Here the land is flat, the river slow and wide, several miles across 
in the wet season. Silt on its banks forms a natural barrier, but at 
times the river has broken through and caused vast flooding, and has 
changed course. Near the coast a delta and flood plain form the mouth 
of the Indus. A coastal strip five to 25 miles (8–40 km) wide contains 
scattered mangrove swamps. Canals have been cut through the area, 
providing access for water traffic and trade. The Thar Desert occupies 
the southeast portion of the Indus Plain, spanning both Pakistan and 
India.

Climate
Generally arid, Pakistan lies in a warm temperate zone. The year is 
popularly regarded as having three seasons: summer, rainy season, 
and winter. Hot, summery weather lasts from April to September, 
and cold winters stretch from October to March. Monsoon rains 
drench the region from July to September. Within its borders the 
country has four primary climactic regions. The northern and north-
western mountains have very cold winters with frequent frosts and 
heavy snowfalls. Summers are mild. On the plains to the south, the 
low elevation and absence of sea breezes cause very hot summers. 
During summer days, dry winds called loo blow. In the coastal areas 
to the south the Arabian Sea provides a moderating influence, and 
temperature variations are less extreme. The Baluchistan Plateau has 
a climate similar to that of the northern regions, though warmer in 
both summer and winter.

A Brief History of Pakistan

The Provinces
Today Pakistan is composed of four provinces, Punjab, Sind, the North-
West Frontier Province (NWFP), and Baluchistan, and the Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), a region between southwest NWFP 
and Afghanistan largely outside of government control. The state of 
Jammu and Kashmir is claimed by both Pakistan and India, and the 
dispute over the territory has been the defining issue dividing the two 
nations and inflaming passions on both sides of the border. The portion 
of Jammu and Kashmir that is administered by the federal government 
of Pakistan is divided into the Federally Administered Northern Areas, 
commonly known as the Northern Areas, and Azad Kashmir.

Punjab
Punjab is the most populous and developed of the four provinces. 
Noted for its arts and crafts, it is considered the cultural capital of 
Pakistan. Covering an area of 97,192 square miles (205,346 sq. km), 
Punjab is primarily a plain, though its north is bisected by the Salt 
Range, composed of the Murree and Kahuta hills on the north side 
and the Pubbi Hills of Gujrat in the south. The Potwar Plateau 
(1,000–2,000 feet; 305–610 m) lies north of the Salt Range, between 
the Jhelum River in the east and the Indus River to the west. It is pri-
marily an agricultural area and boasts one of the largest canal irrigation 
systems in the world.

Punjab comprises eight administrative divisions. Its capital, Lahore, 
is linked to most major events and movements in Pakistan’s history. 
Situated on the left bank of the river Ravi, it is bristling with monuments 
and buildings of great architectural and historical note. These include 
the Badshahi Mosque, Emperor Jahangir’s Mausoleum, and the Shalimar 
Gardens. Islamabad, the nation’s capital, lies some 170 miles (275 km) 
north of Lahore. Its twin city, Rawalpindi, is a gateway to the hills and 
mountains of Pakistan’s north, which draw hikers, trekkers, and moun-
tain climbers from around the world. Taxila, another of the province’s 
many points of interest, is an ancient city rich in archaeological sites 
and treasures.

Throughout the province forts, palaces, mosques, and other grand edi-
fices evidence the importance this region has long enjoyed. One of South 
Asia’s earliest existing buildings with enameled tile work, the mausoleum 
of Shah Yusuf Gardezi in Multan, was built here in 1152 c.e.

A Muslim artistic tradition developed in Punjab early in the Mughal 
period, influenced by Central Asian and Persian artists. The renown of

artists such as Abdur Rahman Chughtai (1899–1975) and miniaturist 
Haji Mohammad Sharif (1889–1978) remains undimmed today, and 
their legacy remains alive in contemporary artists who continue in their 
tradition.

Carpet making and pottery, which have a rich history here, are also 
widely practiced today. The pottery of Multan, where the Muslims first 
established a foothold in the region, was famed for its blue glazed pot-
tery as early as the 13th century. Woodwork and metalwork in brass, 
iron, and copper add to the province’s cultural legacy.

Sind
The life and economy of Sind flows on the current of the river Sindhu, 
or Indus, for which the province is named. Yet despite its aqueous

spine, this is among the hottest areas of Pakistan. Jaccobabad, in the 
north of the province, is one of the hottest places on earth, with day-
time temperatures in the summer rising to over 120 degrees F (49°C). 
Comprising three divisions, the province covers 54,198 square miles 
(140,914 sq. km). Sindhi, an ancient language, is spoken by a great 
majority of the population.

The capital, Karachi, has been the nation’s primary seaport since 
the 1700s and is the largest city in Sind. In addition to its position as a 
trading center, Sind is also an industrial powerhouse, producing up to 
half the nation’s goods in some manufacturing sectors. Rice, cotton, and 
wheat give the province a strong agricultural base.

Important archaeological sites are scattered throughout Sind. Just east 
of Karachi, Bhambore marks the site of the seaport of Debal, where the 
first Arab armies came ashore in 711 C.E. and began their conquests in 
the region. Thatta, the former provincial capital, was once a center of 
learning and still contains notable historical architecture. About 60 miles 
(98 km) east of Karachi, it is also the site of the famed Makli Tombs, a 
sprawling necropolis built between the 15th and 17th centuries.

The town of Sehwan predates the Islamic era and includes the ruins 
of Kafir-Qila, a fort reputedly built by Alexander the Great during his 
invasion of the area in the fourth century B.C.E. It is also the site of pil-
grimages by Shia who come to visit the tomb of the 12th-century mystic 
poet, scholar, and saint Shaikh Usman Marvandvi.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Hyderabad was the capital of Sind, 
and today it is noted for colorful handicrafts including glass, lacquered 
furniture, and hand-loomed cloth, as well as several historic forts, 
buildings, and monuments. Crafts remain important throughout the 
province, which is noted for ajrak—local craftwork that includes pot-
tery, carpets, leatherwork, and silk. Sind is also noted for its textiles 
in the form of blankets, gold and silver embroidery, and cotton cloth 
(soosi). As befitting the first outpost of Islam on the subcontinent, 
poetry has long been a part of Sind’s cultural heritage.

North-West Frontier Province (NWFP)
The North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) boasts the largest concen-
tration of high peaks in the world. Containing the restless tribal areas 
and situated astride key mountain passes, including the Khyber Pass, 
NWFP has long been an untamed and strategic corner of the region. 
Most of the invaders who swept into the area that is now Pakistan—
including Alexander the Great, Timur, Emperor Babur, and Mahmud of 
Ghazni—passed this way on their journeys of conquest.

THE LAND AND ITS EARLY HISTORY

The province in its present configuration, covering 29,808 square 
miles (74,521 sq. km), was created in 1901 and divided into “tribal” 
and “settled” areas. The tribal areas are administered by the federal 
government, while the settled areas are ruled by the fairly autonomous 
provincial assembly, as are all the provinces. The province has five 
administrative divisions: Peshawar, Kohat, Hazura, Dera Ismail Khan, 
and Malakand. Each of these is divided into two or more districts. The 
provincial capital is Peshawar. This province was also the home of the 
Gandhara Civilization, noted for its art, which blended Greco-Roman 
and local traditions, often harnessed to glorify Buddha and the religion 
he brought to this region. The valley of Udiyana, in the Swat River val-
ley, was important during the Buddhist era of this region.

Baluchistan
The largest of Pakistan’s four provinces (131,051 sq. miles; 347,190 
sq. km), Baluchistan is a generally inhospitable land, and its lack of 
resources left it relatively undisturbed by regional powers for most of 
its history. Its geography encompasses mountains, coastal plains, and 
rocky deserts on its high plateau. In the south, the Makran Range sepa-
rates the coastal plain from the interior, a region of highland basins and 
deserts.

Southeast Baluchistan is cut by narrow river valleys. With little room 
for alluvial deposits to settle, there is little agriculture. Archaeological 
research in the areas of Mehrgarh, Nausharo, and Pirak in the Kachi 
Plain indicates that settlements existed from the Neolithic period 
through the Iron Age, beginning in the early seventh millennium B.C.E. 
Dams were common to many settlements. The final settlement phase of 
this culture lasted until about 2600 B.C.E., the period when the Indus 
Valley Civilization of the river plains to the east of Mehrgarh was begin-
ning to develop. Evidence from this time period points to mass produc-
tion of pottery and increasing trade and exchange. Near the middle of 
the third millennium B.C.E., traces of human habitation end.

In historic times the area was first claimed by the Persian Empire, 
when it was called Maka. Alexander the Great brought it under nomi-
nal Greek rule in the fourth century B.C.E. The province takes its name 
from the Baluchs, the last of the major ethnic groups to settle in what is 
now Pakistan. The Baluchis, who may have originated from the Caspian 
Sea area, arrived around 1000 C.E., displacing the Meds of Maran and 
other tribes. The great Persian poet Firdausi (Abdul Kasim Mansur; 
932–1021) mentioned the Baluchs and their valor in his epic poem 
Shah Namah (The Book of Kings), along with the warlike Kuch.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Baluchistan became a full-fledged province only in 1969. It has 
six administrative divisions: Quetta, Sibi, Kalat, Makran, Loralai, and 
Nasirabad. Each of these is composed of two or more districts. The 
capital of Baluchistan is Quetta, located by the Bolan Pass.

Three main languages are spoken: Baluchi, Pashto, and Brauhvi. 
Urdu, Pakistan’s national language, is understood as well. The Baluchi, 
the language of the Baluchs, has Indo-Iranian roots. The strong 
national identity of the Baluchis—their tribes extend into Iran and 
Afghanistan—along with the historic lack of government attention and 
services, has made them resistant to being incorporated into the fabric 
of Pakistan. The region has been marked by periodic insurrections that 
continued into the 21st century.

Though only about 1.2 million of its 85 million acres is under culti-
vation, the province’s economy is based on agriculture. The production 
of fruit in Baluchistan gives the province the sobriquet Fruit Garden of 
Pakistan. With little rainfall in the region, irrigation depends mostly 
on wells, karezes (underground water conduits), and springs. Canals 
irrigate about 1,000 square miles (2,590 sq. km). Livestock, primarily 
sheep and goats, are also a mainstay of the agricultural sector. In the 
Arabian Sea to the south, a fishing industry flourishes.

Though rich in minerals including iron ore and copper, Baluchistan 
has lagged in development of these resources. Facilities for the textile, 
pharmaceutical, and gas industries have recently been constructed, 
and the government has established economic incentives to encourage 
investment in the province.

Languages
The language of the Indus Valley Civilization is unknown. The Dardic 
language came with the first wave of Aryans around 1800–1500 B.C.E. 
Once established, the upper classes spoke Sanskrit (an Indo-Aryan 
language), while the masses (composed of indigenous populations) 
spoke what is called North-Western Prakrit, or the language of 
Gandhara. This was possibly an amalgam of local pre-Indo-European, 
Indo-Aryan, Dardic, and East Iranian speech. Today, reflecting its 
polyglot past and the historic isolation of many of its peoples, 
Pakistanis speak a variety of languages. Urdu is the national language, 
and English is the official language, but other common tongues are 
Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, and Baluchi. Most of the myriad languages 
are thought to be offshoots of the Sanskrit spoken by the Aryans three 
millennia ago.

THE LAND AND ITS EARLY HISTORY

Prehistoric Pakistan
Among the earliest fossils found in Pakistan are those of several 
ape species, including Ramapithecus and Sivapithecus, and the larger 
Gigantophithecus dating to the Miocene period, some 9 million years 
ago, unearthed on the Potwar Plateau. The region was also habitat for 
species of pigs, giraffes, antelopes, and other grazing animals. Boars the 
size of contemporary hippopotamuses, sheep larger that horses, and 
mastadons also roamed the landscape. In wet areas, crocodiles, turtles, 
and anthrocheres, a hippolike creature, flourished. Many of these 
creatures became extinct between 5 million and 1.5 million years ago, 
though humanoid apes thrived. But among the apelike creatures that 
thrived here, only Homo sapiens would survive the ice ages. Finding 
shelter in caves, they would learn to control fire and make tools, and 
they left records of their passage and way of life in cave paintings found 
in the central subcontinent.

Early Humans
In the Rawalpindi district, southwest of Islamabad, and the city of 
Rawalpindi near the Soan River, evidence of habitation by pre–Stone 
Age humans who lived between 3 million and 500,000 years ago 
has been found. They were likely hunter-gatherers whose pebble 
tools are the only trace of their existence. Extensive evidence of 
Stone Age, or Paleolithic, cultures has also been found. The most 
primitive tools found, dating to the early Stone Age, are eoliths, 
large stone-flake tools labeled the “pre–Soan” type. Artifacts of the 
so-called Soan Culture have been found on the Potwar Plateau, in the 
Rawalpindi district, the Jhelum River, and tributaries of the Chenab 
River. Middle Stone Age sites, dating to 300,000 to 150,000 years 
ago, have been found near Nomad Lake. By this time, toolmaking 
had improved. Flat chips called flakes were used as spearheads and 
knives. During Late Soan Culture, the use of wooden traps to catch 
fish and small game may have been mastered. In the Sanghao Valley 
near Mardan, stone tools dating to 70,000 years ago have been found. 
The transition from Lower to Upper Paleolithic cultures makes one 
of the most vital evolutions of mankind, and the remnants of the 
Soan Culture show dramatic advances in the manufacture of bone 
and stone tools.

About 10,000 years ago the global climate turned more temperate, 
and the last ice age ended. Receding glaciers were replaced by herds of 
grazing animals and the humans who hunted them. Ultimately some

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

of these grazing animals were domesticated. Agriculture, the Neolithic 
revolution, may have initially developed in order to feed these animals, 
freeing humans from the need to follow migrating herds and allowing 
the establishment of permanent settlements.

Roots of Civilization
The settlement and agricultural exploitation of the region took root 
about 6500–5000 B.C.E. Agriculture came from the west; the first farm-
ing villages in the subcontinent appeared in areas of Baluchistan closest 
to Iran and Afghanistan. Neolithic farming and pastoral communities 
dotted the plains and western highland regions of Baluchistan and 
Afghanistan. The oldest Neolithic site in the subcontinent, found in 
1979, is at Mehrgarh in Dhadar District, six miles south of the Bolan 
Pass, a key route into the region of present-day Pakistan. It dates 
to about 6500 B.C.E. or earlier. The remains of houses of dried mud 
bricks and tools of stone and flint have been identified. Inhabitants 
cultivated barley, oats, and wheat, harvesting them with sickles with 
stone blades. They wove baskets and kept herds of cattle and flocks of 
sheep. Beads, shells, and stones were used to make ornamental items. 
Objects found include necklaces and bracelets made from beads of 
turquoise, marble, lapus lazuli, shell, and steatite, or soapstone. The 
use of stones and shells not native to the area evidence trade with 
peoples from the Arabian Sea to Afghanistan. A copper bead found in 
a grave dating to 5000 B.C.E. is one of the first metal objects found in 
the region.

Numerous Neolithic sites dating to 5000 B.C.E. and later have been 
found throughout Pakistan. Among the artifacts discovered are highly 
polished stone tools, and pottery with beautiful paintings of animals: 
deer, mountain goats, fox, and bison. This pottery, in its style and deco-
ration, likewise shows influences from as far as Iraq. Boxes carved from 
soft stone and figurines believed to be deities, particularly the Mother 
Goddesses, have also been found. From here agriculture spread up the 
Indus Valley. Annual floods of the Indus made the ground rich and pli-
ant enough to obviate the need for plows.

Sometime around 4000 B.C.E. a new ethnic group appeared in the 
Indus region, the Dravidians. Though thought to have come from the 
Middle East, their origins are unknown. Their appearance—not fair 
skinned, high nosed, or flat nosed—indicates they were not related to 
central Asians or Mongolians. Early urban centers began to appear in 
the area about this time. One such community, Rehman Dheri, a few

THE LAND AND ITS EARLY HISTORY

miles north of Dera Ismail Khan in NWFP, had an estimated population 
of 10,000 to 15,000. Inscriptions found on pottery at the site indicate 
script was developing. Remnants of such settlements have been found 
from Sahiwal and Rupar in East Punjab to Karachi and Baluchistan to 
the west.

The Dravidians built planned towns with two-story buildings, 
underground drains, public water supplies and baths, and large grain 
storehouses. More than three dozen sites have been identified. After 
4000 B.C.E. bronze, a combination of copper and tin, became common 
in present-day Pakistan, though stone tools remained the norm in 
Baluchistan.

By 3000 B.C.E. hundreds of farming communities were established 
along the Indus and its tributaries. Several towns were fortified. The 
wheel was in wide use, both for throwing clay on potter’s wheels and 
on carts pulled by draught animals. Toy carts have been found in the 
ruins of Kot Diji and in surrounding areas of the Kot Diji culture. 
Examinations of the pottery found at various sites have led to specu-
lation that much of the culture originated in farming settlements in 
Baluchistan and spread east.

The Indus Valley Civilization
Sometime around 2600 B.C.E. at least two cities were destroyed by fire. 
In both cases, a new city was built atop the ashes of the old. But these 
new metropolises were markedly different from what they replaced. 
Both were built according to a uniform plan. Two large sites, Mohenjo-
Daro (Mound of the Dead), near Larkana in Sind, and Harappa, near 
Sahiwal in the Punjab, are the most notable.

Mohenjo-Daro’s edifices were constructed of durable burned-mud 
brick. Built around a central citadel, wide thoroughfares divided the 
municipal district into large blocks. Large temple-like structures 
include a pillared public bath measuring more than 100 feet by 180 
feet. In residential areas, blocks were smaller and bisected by nar-
rower lanes. Houses ranged from small cottages to roomy two- and 
three-story dwellings, replete with indoor plumbing. A complex 
sewer system, unmatched until the Roman Empire, served the city’s 
sanitation needs.

Since these two cities were discovered in the 1920s, the remnants of 
many more built the same way have been uncovered. All have straight 
north-south and east-west streets. An administrative area was built on 
a vast platform protected by thick-walled fortifications overseen by

watchtowers. Public buildings, granaries, and auditoriums also appear 
to have been common to all.

The Harappans were prosperous agricultural traders known through-
out the ancient world. They traded with Mesopotamia and with Arabian 
Gulf communities. Internal trade likely consisted of cotton, lumber, grain, 
livestock, and other comestibles. A highly standardized system of weights 
controlled trade. The economic growth accompanying urban expansion 
brought increasing social stratification and distinction. The appearance of 
elaborate ornaments of gold, silver, and ivory; terra-cotta figurines; and 
sculpture marked this evolution. They also produced finely painted pot-
tery and carved seals similar to those found in Sumer. The seals were often 
engraved with animals, the most common being a unicorn inscribed with 
pictographic symbols. The symbology has yet to be deciphered.

Though peaceful, they also made weapons of bronze and stone. They 
worshipped many gods and goddesses, most prominently one similar 
to the later Hindu god Shiva. The dead were buried in wooden coffins 
with pottery vessels and simple ornaments. No elaborate or valuable 
items of gold, silver, or precious stones were interred with them.

THE LAND AND ITS EARLY HISTORY

The unity of style and symbology linked the region culturally, but 
individual areas developed distinct, identifiable styles. At the end of 
the era these regional differences hardened, signifying independence as 
well as isolation, limiting the opportunities for advancement that had 
accompanied the earlier interaction.

At its height, the Indus Valley Civilization incorporated an area 
larger than Mesopotamia or Upper Egypt, stretching almost 700 miles 
(684 miles; 1100 km) north to south, from the foothills of the Siwalik 
Mountains to the Tapti River, and the same distance east to west, from 
Quetta in Baluchistan to Bikaner in Rajasthan, India, and Alamgirpur in 
the Upper Ganga–Jamuna doab.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Decline
After 1900–1800 B.C.E. the Indus Valley Civilization began to decline. 
Changes in river patterns wrought by earthquakes are thought to have 
contributed to the downfall of Harappan culture. While the Indus River 
is regarded as the wellspring for the region’s earliest true civilization, at 
the time the region’s greatest river was the Sarasvati, often identified in 
later Aryan accounts as the Ghaggar-Hakra. The Sarasvati River dried 
up and disappeared about 1900 B.C.E., disrupting agriculture and the

economy. The Indus changed course as well, causing destructive floods. 
The demise of the Indus Valley Civilization was mirrored in southeast 
Baluchistan, where settlements and irrigation systems were abandoned. 
Yet the area remained essentially habitable and hospitable, and the rea-
sons for the depopulation are unknown. By about 1700 B.C.E. the Indus 
Valley Civilization had fragmented into smaller regional cultures called 
Late or Post-Harappan cultures.

The Aryans
A few hundred years after the urban centers of the Harappan culture 
had been abandoned, a people who called themselves the Aryans, or 
“noble ones” in Sanskrit, belonging to a large group of seminomadic 
tribes from Central Asia, migrated into the region. Before arriving on the 
subcontinent the larger group called Proto-Indo-Europeans had divided 
into three branches. One went west to Europe, the Iranian Aryans to 
Iran, and the third, the Indo-Aryans, to the subcontinent. Expert horse-
men, aggressive fighters, and armed with iron weapons, the Aryans met 
little resistance. They arrived in the subcontinent in at least two major 
resettlements and ongoing, smaller migrations, the first in about 1,500 
B.C.E. Their language, Dardic, or Old Indo-Aryan, composed of several 
dialects, was restricted to the Pamir mountain region at the time. The 
second wave came about six centuries later. In its aftermath their lan-
guage, now evolved into Indic, became dominant in the Pakistan area. 
The Aryan language also became the root of Sanskrit, Pahlavi, Greek, 
Latin, and ancient forms of Teutonic and Slavic languages. By this time 
the Aryans had supplanted the Indus Valley Civilization. They may 
have driven the Dravidians south into what is now India.

The Aryans had chariots as well as weapons superior to those of 
indigenous forces. Aryans called those they conquered dasyus, meaning 
“inferior people born to serve.” As Aryan society became more strati-
fied, social laws evolved into a caste system of four classes. The highest 
were the Brahmans, priests who provided the link between men and 
god. Kshatriyas, the second caste, were warriors, commanders, lead-
ers, and kings. The Vaishya caste consisted of artists, artisans, farm-
ers, traders, and, later, minor officials. And the lowest caste, Shudras, 
were menial workers. Rule over Aryan tribes was primarily hereditary, 
though citizens had a voice through some elections. The king was 
crowned by Brahmans. The castes first developed as an open system, 
allowing Kshatriyas and Vaishyas to move up as their capabilities 
allowed. But over time the system became fixed.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

The Epics
Knowledge of the Aryans primarily comes from their collection of 
sacred hymns, called the Vedas, meaning sacred knowledge. The Vedas 
include the Rig-Veda Samhita, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Veda, and Atharva-
Veda. The Rig-Veda Samhita (Samhita means collection) is the source 
of all Vedic lore and religion. The Vedic pantheon contains 33 gods 
divided into groups of 11 in three categories: atmospheric (Indra), ter-
restrial (Agni), and celestial (Surya or Vishnu). Reference to astronomi-
cal phenomena leads scholars to believe the Vedas refer to incidents as 
early as 4500 B.C.E.

Two epic poems recount the heroic deeds of the early Aryans, and 
these traditions had a large influence on Hindu life and outlook. One, 
the Ramayana, was reputedly composed by Valmiki, a Hindu sage, 
although the date of its creation is unknown; the version that survives 
today is thought to date from between 500 and 100 B.C.E. The other 
epic, the Mahabharata, is a longer, episodic poem. The major portion 
of the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, a series of moral lectures from 
Lord Krishna to Arjuna, archer-prince, before going into battle.

Other sacred writings include the Brahmanas, commentaries on the 
Vedas that were written ca. 700–500 B.C.E.; and the Upanishads, con-
sidered among the greatest religious works in the world. These latter 
writings represent the height of Hindu culture.

The language of the religious texts, Sanskrit, was sacred and per-
sonified by a goddess. About 400 B.C.E. a grammarian, Panini, devel-
oped some 4,000 rules for the language. Later the scholars Ktayayana 
(ca. 250 B.C.E.) and Patanjali (ca. 150 B.C.E.) wrote commentaries on 
Panini’s work, adding to the codification of the rules of Sanskrit.

The religion was polytheistic, with gods representing the sky, sun, 
moon, thunder, rain, earth, and rivers. Indra, god of war, sacker of cit-
ies, and bringer of rain, was the earliest of them and was originally the 
king of the deities. But over centuries a Hindu trinity emerged: Brahma, 
the creator; Vishnu, the preserver; and Shiva, the destroyer. Shiva ulti-
mately evolved into both creator and destroyer. Vishnu was the savior 
of mankind.

Aryan Society
The basic Aryan political unit was the grama, or village, and its leader 
was the gramani. A jana was a larger area, and a vis was likely a subdi-
vision of a jana. Rashtra was the state and was ruled by a raja, or king, 
who was also called gopa, or protector. Samrat was the supreme ruler.

THE LAND AND ITS EARLY HISTORY

Early Vedic society was nomadic and cattle herding the chief occupa-
tion. There were no coins or money at the time, and cows served as 
their currency. Families were patrilineal, with wealth passed from father 
to eldest son. The Aryan diet consisted primarily of grain and cakes, 
milk and milk products, and fruits and vegetables. Horse meat was 
consumed, but cows were seldom eaten due to their value, and their 
use as food declined over time.

Agriculture grew in importance and became the dominant economic 
activity as Aryan culture became more sedentary. Concurrently several 
small kingdoms emerged, often at war with one another. Some Vedic 
literature refers to 16 great kingdoms, or mahajanapadas. During this 
time two leadership groups emerged, the Brahmans and Kshatriyas. The 
former developed elaborate sacrifices and specialization, and proper 
enunciation of sacred verses became essential for divine intervention 
in granting wealth and victory in war. Over time the alliance between 
these two groups grew stronger.

From about 1500 to 1000 B.C.E. the area of present-day Pakistan 
where the Aryans ruled remained independent of the rest of what is 
now India. Once the Aryans migrated east to the Gangetic Plains, the 
area that is now Pakistan reverted to its insular existence. Little is 
known about the events that occurred in the region between 1000 and 
500 B.C.E.

INROADS OF ARMIES AND 
IDEAS (500 B.C.E.–700 C.E.)

The migration of the Aryans from the Indus to the Ganges valley 
around 1000 B.C.E. left what is now Pakistan largely autonomous. 

But by the middle of the first millennium B.C.E. the region’s isolation 
had given way to a series of invasions of ideas and armies. Jainism and 
Buddhism were the first of the former, which left indelible marks on the 
region’s society and culture that still echo today. The armies came from 
Persia, Greece, and Central Asia, each earning a place in the region’s 
history. Concurrently, the Hindu kingdoms that developed in India 
from Aryan roots periodically held sway over the Indus region from 
whence they originated.

The Path to Enlightenment
In the sixth century B.C.E., near the end of the Indus region’s period 
of obscurity, spiritual and intellectual revolutions were reshaping the 
ancient world. New thinkers advanced ideas that profoundly changed 
views of life and religion. These guiding spirits included Zoroaster 
(ca. 628–551 B.C.E.) in Iran; Pythagoras (ca. 570–500 B.C.E.) in Greece; 
Confucius (551–479 B.C.E.) and Laozi (fl. sixth century) in China; and 
Siddhartha Gautama (ca. 623–543 B.C.E.), known as the Buddha, and 
Mahavira (ca. 599–527 B.C.E.), who spread Jainism, in India.

Jainism
Mahavira was born a prince at Vaisali, near Patna, India. The son of 
Siddhartha, chief of the Nat Clan of the Kshatriyas, his given name 
was Vardhamana. At age 30 he gave up his life of ease to embark on 
a spiritual quest and wandered as a monk for 13 years until attaining 
supreme knowledge. He spent the next 30 years preaching throughout

the subcontinent, teaching the faithful how to achieve release (moksha) 
from earthly concerns by avoiding sinful thoughts and desires and by 
avoiding causing harm to others. As did Buddhists, he believed every 
living being was influenced by karma, the accumulated energy of all 
the individual’s good and bad deeds. Followers called him Jina, the 
conqueror, and later Mahavira (taken from the Sanskrit word mahavir, 
meaning very brave and courageous).

Jainism and Buddhism are considered to have developed contem-
poraneously, as their founders lived at the same time. But Mahavira 
based his teachings on Jaina traditions that went back centuries in the 
Indus Valley. Within Jainism, he is regarded as the 24th, last, and most 
important of the tirthankaras, ford makers, or pathfinders. The previous 
tirthankara, Parshvanatha, or Parshva, and the first for whom historical 
evidence exists, probably lived in the ninth century B.C.E. Mahavira, 
over his years of preaching, brought many new adherents to the faith. 
His sermons were memorized by followers, and over hundreds of years 
they were collected in the Agam Sutras (canonical literature). Punjab 
eventually became a stronghold of Jainism, with a large community in 
Lahore. Most adherents moved to the Indian portion of Punjab follow-
ing independence in 1947.

Buddhism
As Mahavira spread his message, another scion of nobility who would 
have even greater impact on the region was on a similar mission. 
Siddhartha Gautama was the son of the chief of Kapilavastu, a princi-
pality at the foot of the Himalayas. Gautama abandoned his life of ease 
and pleasure and set off on a search for truth, wandering first as a her-
mit and later attracting followers as he preached during his journey. His 
quest eventually brought him enlightenment and he was proclaimed as 
Buddha, a Sanskrit word meaning “enlightened one” or “awakened one.” 
(The title applies to anyone who has received enlightenment, though 
is often used to refer to Gautama, who was also called by the religious 
name Shakyamuni.) Gautama believed in reincarnation and preached 
that karma, the accreted spirit of one’s good and bad deeds, determines 
the quality of the next life. The key to enlightenment lay in connect-
ing to dharma, the truth of the world’s nature, which is only possible 
by elevating one’s karma through thought and deed. This would allow 
the attainment of nirvana, an exalted state of bliss and understanding. 
Gautama also taught that there is no intermediary between humans and 
the divine spirit and that he himself was merely a guide.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

The Buddha’s message struck a responsive cord among those dis-
enchanted with the rigid social stratification practiced by the Hindus. 
One of the Buddha’s primary patrons was Bimbisara, the fifth Saisunaga 
ruler of the Hindu kingdom of Magadha, one of three larger kingdoms 
founded by the Aryan tribes who had migrated east from Pakistan. 
Magadha dominated the northeast region of the subcontinent. The 
king ruled from the capital at Rajgir. He married a Kosala princess 
and annexed the neighboring kingdom of Anga. According to legend, 
Bimbisara invited Gautama to visit his court at Rajgir before he had 
achieved enlightenment. When Gautama declined, Bimbisara invited 
him to return once his quest was completed. Having attained enlight-
enment, the Buddha and his monks visited Bimbisara’s court, and the 
ruler awarded him property for use in his teachings. Bimbisara was 
later deposed by his son Ajatasattu, imprisoned, and starved to death. 
Ajatasattu (also spelled Ajatasatru and Ajatashtru) built a new capital 
at Pataliputra and made Magadha into the most powerful of the three 
Hindu kingdoms.

It was during this time of spiritual awakening that foreign incur-
sions—Persian and Greek from the west, and later empires from the 
south—brought the Indus region under outside control.

Persian Conquest
The area that is now Pakistan may have come under Persian domina-
tion as early as the reign of that empire’s founder, Cyrus the Great 
(ca. 585–529 B.C.E.). Under his grandson and second successor, 
Darius I (r. ca. 522–486 B.C.E.), the area of Sind and Punjab became 
the 20th satrapy, or province, of the Achaemenian Empire, as the 
Persian dominion was known. Darius called the new Persian province 
the Sind Satrapy, after Sindhu, the ancient name of the Indus River. 
References to Sindhu and Hindu figures are found on inscriptions in 
the ancient Persian cities of Kermanshah, Susa, and Persepolis and 
refer to Hapta Hindva (the Seven Rivers) as belonging to Darius’s 
empire. Herodotus (ca. 484–420 B.C.E.), the Greek historian, wrote 
that Darius had dispatched Scylax to lead an exploratory mission to 
the Indus River valley in 517 B.C.E. Once under its suzerain, Sind was 
the richest of Persia’s provinces and, according to Herodotus, “paid 
a tribute exceeding that of every other people” (Herodotus, Persian 
Wars, Book III, 204), due in part to the heavy rainfall and many rivers 
that nourished the land. Darius also conquered the doab between the 
Indus and Jhelum Rivers.

INROADS OF ARMIES AND IDEAS

Commerce followed conquest. Trade increased, and several cities 
were established along caravan routes. With growing prosperity, the 
arts and philosophy took more prominent roles in society. Taxila, near 
Rawalpindi, which would later be renowned for its art and commerce, 
is thought to have first flourished as such a capital during this time. 
Charsadda, on Peshawar’s trade route, is thought to have been another 
of the thriving metropolises of the era. An additional result of Persian 
influence was the introduction of the Kharoshthi script, read from right 
to left, to the subcontinent.

By the last half of the sixth century B.C.E. Gandhara (consisting of 
present-day Peshawar in NWFP and the Rawalpindi area of the Punjab) 
had been added to Persia’s territory as a separate province. Portions of 
Sind west of the Thar Desert and the Punjab east of the Indus are also 
thought to have come under Persian rule, as did the entire length of 
the Indus River itself, from Upper Punjab to the Arabian Sea. However, 
the region remained administratively independent. The rajas who ruled 
the small kingdoms that comprised present-day Pakistan simply swore 
fealty to their Persian lords, paid their tribute, and provided military 
assistance when needed. This independence grew over time as the 
Persian Empire’s power began to fade.

Darius used the region’s military assistance to further expand his 
empire. He used Pakistani troops in his victorious first campaign against 
the Greeks, which expanded the Persian Empire as far west as the river 
Danube. And when Darius dispatched Xerxes (r. 485–465 B.C.E.) to lead 
a subsequent campaign against Greece, troops from Pakistan were again 
part of the invasion force. Herodotus wrote of the cavalry and chariots 
that came from the Indus satrapy, and of their bows and arrows of cane 
sheathed in iron. He also noted their garments of cotton.

Besides bringing the Indus region under foreign influence, its link 
with Persia also created a history and cultural identity for this area 
unique and independent from that of the rest of the subcontinent. It is 
among the divisions between what are now Pakistan and India that per-
sist to the present. For almost two hundred years what is now Pakistan 
remained the collective vassal of Persia’s rulers. But internal conflict 
still occurred as local kingdoms fought for greater regional dominance, 
and would-be rajas sought to usurp the power of established rulers.

Alexander the Great
In the fourth century the Persian Empire fell to another great invader 
from the west, Alexander the Great (356–323 B.C.E.). The son of Philip

of Macedonia, Alexander took the throne upon his father’s death in 
336 B.C.E. As a prince he had harbored dreams of military conquest, 
and upon becoming king he put his plans into action. The Persian 
Achaemenian Empire, at the time the world’s most powerful, was his 
first objective. After taking two years to organize his army, in 334 B.C.E. 
Alexander led his troops eastward. Darius III (ca. 380–330 B.C.E.), who 
ruled the Achaemenian Empire at the time, gathered forces from across 
the empire to battle the invaders. His forces included Bactrians and 
Sogdians from what is now Pakistan. Their assistance in this and previ-
ous campaigns pitting the Persians against the Greeks did not escape 
Alexander’s attention.

Alexander defeated Darius at Issus in 333 B.C.E., though the Persians 
survived the defeat. Suspending his campaign long enough to conquer 
both the Phoenicians in present-day Lebanon, and Egypt in the years 
332–331 B.C.E., Alexander returned to rout Darius at Gaugamela in 
331 B.C.E. He looted and burned Persepolis and several other Persian 
cities.

The Indus Campaign
In 327 B.C.E., after adding Khurasan and Bactria to his conquests, 
Alexander marched his army toward Afghanistan and points east. 
Enlisting Pashtun tribesmen to join his forces, Alexander crossed into 
present-day Pakistan via the northern route through Bajaur and Swat. 
His campaign lasted from June through December. Consolidating 
his victories, Alexander married Kleophis, queen of the Assakenoi 
(Asvakas), the region’s most powerful tribe. Continuing the advance, in 
February of 326 B.C.E. Alexander crossed the Indus River at Ohind, 12 
miles north of Attock. He was welcomed by Taxila’s ruler, Raja Ambhi. 
Alexander spent some time here enjoying the hospitality of this center 
of culture and learning. But the adjacent kingdom, middle Punjab, 
ruled by Porus (d. 317 B.C.E.), resisted the Greeks, gathering forces that 
included 200 war elephants, 300 chariots, 4,000 cavalry, and 30,000 
infantry. Alexander met the Punjabi army at Jhelum ford that July and 
defeated Porus in what would become known as the Battle of Hydaspes. 
In recognition of Porus’s valiance in battle, Alexander allowed him to 
keep his throne. (This also served to limit future insurrections among 
local populations.)

After defeating Punjab, Alexander advanced to the Hyphasis River 
(modern-day Beas River). He wanted to continue his conquests and 
defeat Magadha, the Hindu kingdom to the east, but his soldiers, weary

from the long campaign, refused to go farther. Alexander spent three 
days cloistered in his tent before emerging to order his army’s with-
drawal, after having 12 pillars marking his conquests erected by the 
river. On his way back through Pakistan he marched south and fought 
the Malavas (Malloi in Greek), whose kingdom was in western and 
central India, before conquering Multan. His army suffered numerous 
casualties during the campaign. Along the route he established garri-
sons manned by troops he left in place and founded towns that would 
be populated by settlers who would come from Greece and other parts 
of the empire. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (fl. first century B.C.E.) 
wrote that Alexander himself recruited 10,000 people to reside in a city 
he founded in the lower Indus region.

Continuing south in Multan, Alexander crossed the Hub River near 
Karachi. Upon arriving at the mouth of the Indus he divided his army 
in two. Half he sent back by sea, while the other half returned over 
land. He had spent 10 months in what is now Pakistan, traversing its 
length and breadth. History records that Alexander and his generals 
were much impressed with the culture they found in Pakistan and the 
prowess of its military, which was superior to the armies Alexander 
had faced in Asia Minor and Asia up to that point. On the way back 
to Macedonia, Alexander died. His generals fought over his empire. 
Seleucus I Nicator (358–281 B.C.E.) gained the largest part, extending 
from Asia Minor to Bactria, including present-day Pakistan. He contin-
ued Alexander’s practice of building new towns in an effort to cement 
Greece’s hold on the land.

Alexander’s Legacy
Alexander’s invasion brought Hellenistic culture to the area, notwith-
standing the influences already absorbed by soldiers from the region 
who had battled on the Greek’s home soil more than a century and a 
half before. Local soldiers who joined Alexander’s armies or that of his 
successors quickly learned and adapted to Western customs and ways. 
But in the immediate aftermath of his invasion, Alexander’s influence 
was negligible. With his limited resources, he left administrations as he 
found them for the most part and made no effort to recast the culture in 
the Macedonian mold. And unlike the barbarity that marked Alexander’s 
assault on Persia, cities and civilians were spared the depredations of his 
army. He came, he conquered, he left. However, garrisons Alexander 
established to present a facade of Greek rule would play a role in the 
region’s political and cultural future.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Chandragupta and the Mauryan Empire
Alexander had created a superb army. The lessons of his methods and 
strategies were adopted by local rulers, for whom warfare had been an 
art, science, and instrument of state for centuries. Chandragupta Maurya 
(r. 322–298 B.C.E.) was one such ruler. A Punjabi noted as remarkable, 
brave, and ruthless, he established a kingdom, the Mauryan empire, in 
the Ganges River valley. The first major Indian state, it ruled the upper 
half of the subcontinent until 185 B.C.E. His renowned court was at 
Pataliputra (near present-day Patna), the largest city in the east in its 
time, covering some 13 square miles (34 sq. km). Pataliputra was filled 
with palaces, temples, a university, gardens, parks, and other public 
buildings and spaces. The king, whose palace contained hundreds of 
rooms, was protected by a crack corps of formidable female soldiers. 
Chandragupta’s minister Kautilya (Chanakya), author of a textbook on 
government administration and political strategy, was instrumental in 
the kingdom’s expansion and administration.

Chandragupta had failed in an earlier effort to conquer Magadha, 
undertaken in an alliance with the Greeks when Alexander was in 
Punjab. After Alexander’s death, Chandragupta again attacked Magadha, 
this time defeating the kingdom and claiming its throne.

In 305 B.C.E. Chandragupta battled Seleucus, Alexander’s successor, 
near the Indus River, emerging victorious. In the subsequent peace 
treaty, Seleucus ceded all of present-day Pakistan and part of Ariana, 
present-day Afghanistan, to Chandragupta. To cement the treaty, 
Chandragupta married Seleucus’s daughter and gave Seleucus 500 
war elephants. This marked the end of Greek rule in Pakistan, though 
descendants of these Greek immigrants would one day rule the region. 
Cordial relations between the Greeks and Chandragupta were main-
tained. Megasthenes (350–290 B.C.E.), an ambassador sent to the court 
by Seleucus, wrote an account of Chandragupta’s kingdom, reporting 
on the government, trade, the capital, and the army.

Greek influence had remained limited in the region, but under 
Chandragupta Hellenistic ideas and culture sparked an intellectual 
renaissance in the royal court, stimulating interest in the arts and sci-
ences. A century later the descendants of Greek garrisons left in Bactria 
would invade Punjab and establish a line of Bactrian kings.

Ashoka
After Chandragupta’s death his son Bindusara (r. ca. 298–273 B.C.E.) 
continued the empire’s expansion, conquering the Deccan. But it was

INROADS OF ARMIES AND IDEAS

Bindusara’s son and successor, Ashoka (r. ca. 269–232 B.C.E.), who was 
regarded as the most able of the dynasty’s kings, and, indeed, was one of 
history’s great rulers. His first major conquest, in 261 B.C.E., was of the 
Kalinga kingdom in the present-day Orissa province of India. Though 
his kingdom was expanded with the sword, the blood shed in his war 
with the Kalingas so repulsed Ashoka that he became a Buddhist and, 
according to lore, a devout missionary. This turned all of Pakistan on 
a path toward Buddhism, on which it largely remained until Islam 
appeared about 1,000 years later. Thus Pakistan was under Hindu rule 
for only a relatively short time.

A paternal ruler, Ashoka regarded his subjects as his children and spon-
sored works of architecture and education. Greeks played a large role in 
these latter activities, and Ashoka also apparently relied on his Yavana, or 
Greek subjects, and Greek nobles to assist in his empire’s administration. 
Ultimately Ashoka’s kingdom stretched from Afghanistan to the Cavery 
River in south India. His death began the Mauryan empire’s decline. 
Mauryan control over Pakistan had been limited, and the descendants of 
the Greeks who had come with Alexander and established themselves in 
northwest Pakistan gradually asserted their power.

The Bactrian Kingdom
Though Seleucus had ceded Greek territory to the Mauryans a century 
before, descendants of Greeks who had been garrisoned in the area 
gained control of Bactria (Balkh in northern Afghanistan) and areas west 
of the Hindu Kush under their ruler Demetrius I (fl. second century 
B.C.E.). Bactria’s dominion expanded eastward, and by about 200 B.C.E. 
the Mauryans had been driven from the region. Local rulers asserted their 
autonomy and sought security, as they had each time an empire’s retreat 
left them free and exposed. In about 185 B.C.E., under Appolodidus, 
the Greco-Bactrians began a series of campaigns of conquest in what is 
now Pakistan. In 175 B.C.E. Appolodidus’s successor, Menander (r. ca. 
155–130 B.C.E.), also known as Milinda or Menandros, invaded Punjab, 
establishing the Bactrian kingdom. At its height the kingdom extended 
from Kashmir in the north to the Arabian Sea. Indeed, Bactria’s Greek rul-
ers “had conquered more people than Alexander himself.” (Gankovsky 
1971, 72) Taxila became a renowned center of arts and sciences, draw-
ing scholars from all the known world. The acclaimed sculpture subse-
quently produced throughout Gandhara (Peshawar Valley) and Taxila, 
called the Gandhara school of art, was a result of the mutual influence 
between Buddhist and Hellenistic artistic traditions.

Menander, Bactria’s most powerful king, made his capital at 
Sakala (present-day Sialkot). His kingdom was noted for its seaports, 
mines, cities, and vibrant trade. Like Ashoka he eventually turned 
to Buddhism and was a great patron of Buddhist scholars and teach-
ers. A theological discussion he held with the Buddhist philosopher 
Nagasena was the basis for a noted Pali text, Milindapanha, Questions 
of Milinda.

The Scythians (Sakas)
In the middle of the second century B.C.E. nomadic horsemen from 
Central Asia called Scythians—the first in a progression of these invad-
ers—began to pour into what is now Pakistan. The nomadic tribe had 
invaded and conquered Persia and Khurasan in about 150 B.C.E. The 
Sakas were a branch of the Scythians.

Menander was on a military campaign to expand his kingdom east-
ward at the time, Mathura had already fallen, and Menander was prepar-
ing to advance on the grand city of Pataliputra when he learned of the 
Scythian incursion. He turned his army north to meet them. Menander 
was killed in the ensuing battle, and his death marked the end of the

Bactrian kingdom. Rent by internal rivalries and disputes and bereft of 
its greatest leader, it split into several minor kingdoms.

The Sakas quickly overran the patchwork of Greek-led kingdoms 
and set about building new settlements to accommodate their vast 
numbers. Such was the preponderance of these new arrivals that 
Greek geographers and cartographers began to refer to what is now 
Pakistan as Scythia, while Indians referred to it as Saka-dipa. The Sakas 
quickly assumed rule over the northwest subcontinent. Branches of the 
Sakas founded kingdoms in Taxila, Lower Punjab, Malwa, and Jujarat 
Kathiawar. Their rulers preferred to use the Persian title of satrap.

The first three of the Saka kings were Maues, Azes I, and Azilises. 
Gandhara was their principal stronghold and Taxila their capital. The 
scanty historical evidence indicates the Sakas initially showed deference 
toward the assimilated Greek rulers they conquered. The coins struck 
during their reigns, for example, closely resembled those of the Bactrian 
Greeks they supplanted. But after several decades the Saka rulers felt 
confident enough to assert their supreme authority and display their 
cultural roots. They followed the style of the Pahlavas, or Parthians of 
Iran, in time even turning the throne over to Pahlava princes. One of 
these princes, Gondophares (ca. 20–48 C.E.), announced his indepen-
dence from Parthian control, establishing the Indo-Parthian Kingdom. 
Early ecclesiastical accounts suggest the Christian apostle St. Thomas 
was martyred here after coming to the region—and even Gondophares’s 
court—to preach. Over some 100 years of the Indo-Parthian kingdom’s 
existence, it grew at the expense of the Sakas to encompass present-day 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India. The capital, originally at 
Taxila, was relocated to Kabul shortly before the kingdom’s demise.

Though Greek rule had ended, their language remained in use by the 
ruling and upper classes into the common era. In the second half of the 
first century C.E., the king of Taxila, for example, spoke fluent Greek.

The Kushans
While the Sakas were losing hegemony in what is now Pakistan in the 
middle of the first century C.E., another wave of Central Asian nomads 
appeared. The Yuezhi (Yueh-chih) had been pushed from China’s border 
region by stronger tribes that seized their grazing lands. The branch 
of the tribe that overran Pakistan was the Kushans. After conquering 
Bactria they continued south across the Hindu Kush and seized the 
Kabul Valley. In 48 C.E., under the command of a Tokhari prince, Kujula 
Kadphises (30–80 C.E.), they invaded Punjab, Saka territory. Kujula’s son,

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Kadphises II, who succeeded him, completed the conquest of the Sakas. 
But the Saka princes were often allowed to retain their rule, and only 
had to swear their allegiance to their Kushan lords. Such was the reten-
tion of their power and status that this period of subjugation is called 
the Saka era, a name bestowed by the Kushans themselves. It began in 
78 C.E., when Kanishka (d. ca. 126 C.E.), their most able ruler, took the 
throne and started a new calendar, dubbing it the Saka era. Kanishka 
established the Kushan capital in Purusapura, modern Peshawar, and 
continued the expansion of the empire. He extended its territory into 
Central Asia, all of Afghanistan, and much of northern India, in addition 
to all of Pakistan. The Kushans controlled the trade routes linking Rome 
and China from their capital. Their ambassadors were frequent visitors 
to Rome and China. The empire grew into one of the great civilizations 
of its time, noted for both its size and its power, and the advanced state 
of its social and cultural life. In addition to being a warrior-statesman, 
Kanishka was a great patron of the arts. And though the Kushan had tra-
ditionally been pagans, Kanishka, like Menander and Ashoka before him, 
became a Buddhist. The Gandhara school of art, which had first emerged 
under Bactrian rule a few centuries earlier, flourished during this time.

Both Buddhism and Gandhara art 
achieved their greatest glories 
in Pakistan under the Kushans, 
and under Kanishka’s patronage 
Buddhism spread to Central Asia 
and China.

Buddhism itself was undergo-
ing a transformation. At first seen 
as a teacher, Buddha over time 
was elevated to the status of a 
god, worthy of worship. This led 
to a great deal of temple building. 
Hindus and Jains also made the 
ancestral heroes of their legends 
and lore into deities, human rein-
carnations of gods.

was replaced that same year by 
Vasudeva I. By the end of the 
second century C.E. the Kushan empire was in decline. The power 
vacuum was filled by the rulers, or shahs, of Iran’s Sassanid dynasty. The 
Sassanians conquered the Persians in 226 C.E. under Ardeshir (r. 226–
241 C.E.). Soon after, his son, Shapur I (r. ca. 241–272 C.E.), laid claim to 
what is today Pakistan. Shapur’s son, Narses, was made shah of Seistan, 
Baluchistan, Sind, and the coast of what is now Pakistan. However, 
the Kushans were able to retain their control of central Pakistan and 
the Kabul Valley (while the Saka rulers retained their kingdoms under 
them). The Kushans exercised this power until the fifth century, when 
their kingdom, along with all others around them, fell to new invaders 
from Central Asia.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Mauryan kingdom: Chandragupta I (r. ca. 320–335 C.E.). The founder 
of the Gupta empire, Chandragupta I was the earliest king to have left 
a historical record of his rule.

His son Samudragupta (r. 330/335–380) was a poet and musician as 
well as a fearless and aggressive warrior. Under Samudragupta’s rule, 
the Guptas, as the dynasty was later known, were accepted as the sub-
continent’s preeminent kings. Samudragupta conquered all of Upper 
India and counted the rulers of Punjab and Malwa among his vassals; 
these and other Hindu vassal states flourished under the Guptas’ reign. 
Samudragupta expanded the Gupta empire southward to Kalinga (pres-
ent-day Orissa Province).

Chandragupta II (r. 376/380–415), who took the title vikramad-
itya (son of valor), continued the empire’s expansion. He conquered 
the holdout Saka kingdom of Ujjain (in present-day Madhya Pradesh 
Province, India) as well as the key seaports on the western coast of 
India—including Broach, Surat, Kalyan, and Sopara—that were cru-
cial for the trade between the Mediterranean world and western Asia. 
The Gupta empire grew rich from its control of the sea trade, and 
Chandragupta II was highly regarded. The renown of his court and its 
splendors was such that, under the name Raja Bikram, he became the 
heroic subject of a cycle of popular folk tales.

Art of all kinds flourished under the Guptas, as did the sciences 
and religious writing. Hinduism itself underwent a revival during the 
Gupta years, a process that included the codification of the caste sys-
tem. Leading literary works were reconfigured to reflect and bolster the 
revised tenets.

The empire retained its vigor and position under Kumaragupta (r. 
415–455), who succeeded Chandragupta II. Kumaragupta’s successor, 
Skandagupta (r. 455–467), was adjudged to be an even more skillful 
ruler. But, nonetheless, under his reign the empire would be lost as the 
region faced what would be its most ruinous invasion in history: the 
onslaught of the White Huns. When they first appeared in the mid-fifth 
century, sweeping down from the plains of Central Asia like so many 
before them, Skandagupta emerged victorious from several battles, 
killing tens of thousands of the invaders. But more came, and under 
repeated attacks the Guptas’ empire declined. By the mid-sixth century 
their power had ended.

The Huns
Unlike previous invaders who added to established kingdoms, the 
Huns who swept into the subcontinent from Central Asia through the

northwest mountain passes were nomads who are recorded as having 
enjoyed barbarity and bloodshed. These were Ephthalite, or White 
Huns, part of the same nomadic group that invaded Europe under the 
leadership of Attila (d. 453). With their ferocious assaults and terrifying 
reputations, the Huns quickly conquered Bactria, Kabul, and Gandhara. 
Their conquest of Kashmir, the Punjab, and Malwa soon followed.

The invasion of the Huns turned a new page in Pakistan’s and the 
subcontinent’s history. All the traditions of previous empires, of the 
Guptas, Kushans, Sakas, and Mauryas, would be forgotten, and from 
this time forward new traditions would evolve. As had happened with 
all previous invaders, the Huns changed as they became inevitably 
assimilated into the culture. The Huns and their brethren invaders 
eventually became Hindus. But first they wrought a complete reorder-
ing of the existing clan structures; some clans were stripped of all they 
had, while others that possessed nothing were elevated to positions of 
power under the new rulers. The remnants of the high caste assisted in 
the transformation. The Brahmans invested in the new ruling class the 
same qualities and spiritual purity they had previously applied to their 
traditional warrior-king caste, the Kshatriya of the Vedic scriptures. 
Mirroring this transference, the term Raja-putra, king’s son, later short-
ened to Rajput, the designation for the members of the ruling clans 
and families, became the equivalent of the term Kshatriya. The Rajputs 
would found kingdoms of their own.

Malwa, taken by the Huns under the leadership of Toramana (ca. 
448–510) in about 500, served as their headquarters. The rule of 
Toramana and his son Mihiragula (or Mihirakula; r. ca. 510–542) 
was so brutal and inept that it finally triggered a revolt. The prince of 
Malwa, Yasodharman (r. 520–530), and the Gupta king of Magadha, 
Baladitya, the son of Skandagupta, organized the Hindu rajas to rise 
up against Mihiragula. They met in battle around 532, and Mihiragula 
was defeated. Exiled from his former kingdom, Mihiragula settled in 
Kashmir, where he deposed the reigning king and ruled the area until 
his death a few years later.

The victory over Mihiragula thrust Yasodharman to the forefront 
of regional rulers. He conquered all the former Gupta lands and took 
the title vishnuvardhan. He also, like other Hindu kings before and 
after, took the title vikramaditya. A patron of the arts and literature, 
Yasodharman reigned over a court that, according to contemporary 
accounts, possessed “nine gems,” the famed scholars and experts in 
his retinue, evoking the “nine gems” of Hindu mysticism; each of the 
latter was thought to possess astrological powers and could be worn

individually or combined in a necklace or amulet for their powers at 
appropriate times.

Magadha, which had regularly served as a power center for regional 
rulers going back centuries, again became a dominant kingdom. 
Following Yasodharman’s reign a dynasty of kings whose names were 
suffixed with gupta ruled from here for several decades, though their 
connection to the imperial Guptas is unclear.

The Maukharis of Kanauj
Since the time of the Maurya dynasty the Maukhari had been a promi-
nent tribe. In the sixth century a new line of Maukhari kings arose. 
They had ruled as chieftains in the Gaya district as vassals of the 
imperial Guptas and had developed an independent kingdom that con-
stantly fought with the second Gupta line. Toward the end of the sixth 
century the Maukhari succeeded in expelling the Guptas from Magadha 
and afterward dominated upper India.

Harshavardhana (ca. 590–648), raja of Thanesar (a holy Hindu 
town north of Delhi), was the younger son of Prabhakaravardhana, a 
ruler famed for victories against the Gujaras, Malavas, and other tribal 
invaders. Harsha followed in his father’s footsteps and for several years 
fought to establish rule over the northern subcontinent. Prabhakara 
died in 604, and, after his elder son was assassinated in 606, nobles 
selected Harsha to be king.

About this time the heirless last ruler of the Maukhari dynasty, 
Grahavarman, was killed in battle and his army defeated by the Malwa 
king. Grahavarman was married to Harsha’s sister, and after his death 
she and other Maukhari nobles invited Harsha to take the throne of 
their kingdom. Harsha agreed. He then raised an army said to num-
ber 100,000 cavalrymen and conquered Punjab, Bihar, Malwa, and 
Gujarat. He continued south to the Deccan, where he was defeated, and 
accepted Narmada River as the boundary of his empire. Making Kanauj 
his capital, he turned his efforts from expanding to administering the 
kingdom.

Though he reigned at a time when the region’s fortunes were in 
decline, Harsha, a scholar, poet, and dramatist as well as a monarch, 
is regarded as the last of the great Hindu rulers. During an assembly 
Harsha convened in Kanauj in honor of a visiting Chinese chronicler, 
Xuanzang, an attempt was made on the king’s life in a plot engineered 
by Brahmans. Nonetheless, Xuanzang wrote a vivid, complimentary 
account of the kingdom and Harsha’s court.

Harsha died in 648 without an heir. A minister seized power. He 
attacked and robbed a Chinese envoy, who escaped to Nepal, which 
was Tibet’s suzerain. Tibet’s king was married to a Chinese princess and 
attacked Kanauj to avenge the ambassador’s honor. After this incident 
the Maukhari empire disintegrated into small states that remained inde-
pendent throughout the century.

The Rajput
Upper India remained in turmoil for a century after Harsha’s death. The 
landscape was dotted with small kingdoms inhabited by descendants 
of the Huns, Gurjaras, and allied tribes that had invaded and since 
settled, and their rajas were in frequent conflict with one another. The 
Rajput, or sons of the king, inheritors of the Vedic Kshatriya tradition, 
came to power during this period. Their appellation was both literal 
and figurative. They were indeed the sons of the monarchs of assorted 
kingdoms when the title Rajput was adopted. But some began to claim 
divine descent, and the kings they cited as their fathers included the 
sun, the moon, and fire. Over time the name came to apply to all mem-
bers of the ruling class and to all members of the tribes they led. The 
Rajput developed their own social order, founded on a strong code of 
conduct and honor. Boys were trained in the art of warfare and horse-
manship from a young age. Much of their fighting was against other 
Rajputs.

The first major Rajput kingdom was founded in 816 by Nagabhata 
II (r. 805–833) on territory wrested from Kanauj. Kanauj had been 
under Kashmir and Bengal’s control since Harsha’s death, and its rul-
ers served at the pleasure of these powerful neighbors. Pratihara, as 
the kingdom was known, grew to encompass much of northern India 
and retained its power until early in the 10th century. Raja Mahira 
Pratihara (r. ca. 836–890), also known more popularly as Bhoja, is 
considered the greatest ruler of the line. From his capital at Dhar he 
controlled territory stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the 
Nerbuda in the south, and from the now dried-up river Hakra in the 
west to Magadha, a vassal state in the east. A Hindu, Bhoja maintained 
a large army. His son, Mahendrapala (r. 890–910) took Magadha from 
the Pala kings of Bengal. Mahendrapala was in turn succeeded by his 
son, Mahipala (r. 910–940). But whereas Mahendrapala had been a 
worthy successor to Bhoja, Mahipala was a weak ruler who began to 
lose control over his kingdom. He suffered a grievous defeat in 916 
when Indra III, the Rashtrakuta king of Deccan, raided the kingdom.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Mahipala’s lack of power allowed other kingdoms along his borders 
to gain strength. One bordering kingdom helped the former ruler of 
Magadha regain his lost territory, continuing the decline of Mahipala’s 
empire. The last of the line of this kingdom’s rajas was overthrown by 
Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018–19.

THE COMING OF ISLAM 

(700–1526)

Pakistan was founded as a haven for the subcontinent’s Muslims, 
and today they comprise more than 95 percent of the population. 

But it took centuries before Islam gained more than a foothold here, 
and centuries more before native inhabitants took up the religion in 
great numbers. The roots of Islam in the subcontinent extend back 
to the campaigns of conquest waged by Arab armies in the first years 
after the birth of their religion in the seventh century. Its real impact 
began when Muslim rulers from Central Asia invaded the subcontinent 
through what is now Pakistan in the 11th century. For 500 years a 
succession of Islamic dynasties—the Ghaznavids, Ghurids, and Delhi 
Sultanate among them—ruled significant portions of the region, bat-
tling Hindu kingdoms and migrating nomads. These dynasties laid the 
foundation for one of the greatest kingdoms the world has seen: the 
Mughal Empire.

The subcontinent was accustomed to incursions from outsid-
ers seeking land, treasures, and dominion. But unlike the nomads, 
Persians, or Greeks who preceded them, the Muslims introduced strong 
central government and many other social innovations. Their influence 
transformed the subcontinent and left a legacy of incomparable art and 
architecture, scientific knowledge, and other priceless contributions to 
world heritage. But in the process the Islamic tide created a schism with 
the subcontinent’s Hindu majority that continues to define relations 
between Pakistan and India to this day.

Islam’s First Wave
Islam, the religion brought forth by the prophet Muhammad (ca. 
570–632) on the Arabian Peninsula, created a new social order and 
unified its formerly fractious adherents under a common faith and

political community. Soon after Muhammad’s death, Arab armies set 
off on campaigns of conquest, spreading his message in an effort to 
bring infidels—those who believed in neither Islam nor the religions 
Muhammad considered its forbears, Judaism and Christianity—into 
the flock. In little more than 100 years the Islamic Empire would be 
the largest the world had seen, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to 
outposts on the Indus River. But the lands they conquered, particularly 
at the extremities of the empire, were often in revolt, as local rulers 
sought to preserve their authority. In the Pakistan region local popula-
tions frequently revolted following their subjugation. Periodic military 
campaigns were necessary to reassert control over restive territories.

The Islamic Empire was ruled by the caliph, the spiritual and politi-
cal leader of the Islamic community, or umma. The caliphate, as his 
office and seat of power were known, was initially in Medina, in what 
is now Saudi Arabia. Over the history of the empire, control of the 
caliphate changed hands, and the caliphate moved from Medina to 
Damascus (in what is now Syria) under the Umayyads (660–750) and 
then to Baghdad (in present-day Iraq) under the Abbasids (750–1258); 
ultimately the caliphate resided in Constantinople under the Ottomans 
(1299–1922). Concurrently, rival claimants to leadership of the faith, 
based on lineage to the Prophet, created dynasties of their own, rul-
ing smaller empires from Cairo (the Fatimids), Córdoba in Spain (the 
Umayyads as rivals to the Abbasids), and other capitals.

When Islam arrived on the doorstep of what is now Pakistan, Hun 
and Turkish nomads and warfare between the Persians and Byzantines 
had rendered the region unstable and travel unsafe. The trade between 
East and West along the Silk Route that previously enriched the area 
had dwindled.

The Arabs already knew the area from their knowledge of caravan 
routes and their extensive sea trade. Early in the period of Islamic con-
quests, between the years 637 and 643 during the reign of the Caliph 
Umar (r. 634–644), the Arabs mounted several campaigns in the region. 
Arab naval expeditions raided Debal in Sind and at Thana and Broach 
on the northwest coast of India. A small-scale raid against Makran in 
643 paved the way for a larger invasion the following year, during which 
a Muslim army defeated the forces of the Hindu king of Sind near the 
Indus River. However, after receiving reports of the inhospitable land 
they had conquered, the caliph ordered the army to desist from further 
campaigns and make Makran the easternmost boundary of the empire.

Concurrently, the Arabs conquered Karman, an Iranian province 
that included southern Baluchistan, in 644, and the caliph appointed

THE COMING OF ISLAM

the commander of the force, Suhail ibn Adi, governor of the province. 
Ibn Adi mounted a campaign in Baluchistan that brought some of that 
region under loose Islamic control. Yet even Islamic rule in Karman 
was tenuous, and within a few years the inhabitants revolted. In 652 
Majasha ibn Masood, who was sent by Caliph Uthman (ca. 580–656) 
to retake Karman, reconquered Baluchistan as well, extracting tribute 
payments from its subdued rulers.

In 654 an Arab army under Abdulrehman ibn Samrah was sent to 
pacify areas near Kabul and Ghazni, and by the end of the year all of 
what is now Baluchistan, with the exception of the heavily defended 
mountain redoubt of Kalat (then known as QaiQan), was under Islamic 
control. After 656 insurrections broke out in Baluchistan and Makran 
once more. But the umma was preoccupied with a civil war arising from 
disagreements over succession of the caliphate.

In 660, under the direction of Caliph Ali ibn Abu Talib (r. 656–661), 
Haris ibn Marah Abdi successfully led a large Arab force to reassert 
control over Makran, Baluchistan, and Sind. But in 663, while trying to 
suppress a revolt in Kalat, ibn Marah and most of his army were killed, 
and Islamic control over the Baluchistan region was lost. By then the 
caliphate had been relocated to Damascus under the dynastic control 
of the Umayyads, descendants of one of Muhammad’s early followers. 
Caliph Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan (r. 661–680), founder of the Umayyad 
dynasty, dispatched an overland expedition to recapture the region.

Kabul and the Buddhist holy land of Gandhara, which encom-
passed Kashmir and what is now northern Pakistan, including the 
Peshawar plain, Taxila, and Swat, had been under the rule of the Shahi 
dynasty since the decline of the Kushan empire in the late second 
century. Between the dynasty’s founding—likely by descendants of the 
Kushans—and its decline in the ninth century, some 60 Shahis, as the 
kings were known (a title believed to be derived from the Persian shah or 
shao of Kushan’s rulers, and meant to denote kinship with the Persians, 
either actual or aspirational), ruled the territory, though not without 
interruption. The first of the Shahis were Buddhists. An Arab army 
arrived at Kabul in 663 demanding its king accept Islam. For two years 
the Islamic warriors fought throughout the kingdom and laid siege to 
Kabul, bombarding it with catapults until, in 665, the city fell. The king 
converted, and the Arabs withdrew. The Turkish king of Gandhara, who 
had been Kabul’s vassal, sensed an opening for himself and killed the 
ruler of Kabul, proclaiming himself the kingdom’s lord, or Kabul Shahi. 
He ceded Ghazni-Kandahar in southeastern Afghanistan to his brother, 
and for the next two centuries this Turk Shahi dynasty controlled the

area, serving as a buffer between the Arabs and contemporary northern 
Pakistan. The Arabs made efforts to collect tribute from the two Shahi 
kingdoms, which could only be extracted by waging war, and victory in 
their collection campaigns was often elusive. Indeed, Muawiya ordered 
several campaigns against the region, and only the last, which gained a 
foothold in Makran in 680, achieved any lasting success.

That same year a major schism erupted in Islam, again diverting 
attention and resources from the expansion and consolidation of the 
empire. A battle over the succession of the caliphate resulted in the kill-
ing of Husayn, grandson of the Prophet, and one of the contenders for 
the caliphate. This led to the establishment of the Shi’i branch of Islam 
and its estrangement from the Sunni branch that continues to this day. 
In the aftermath of this upheaval, rulers who had been subjugated by 
Arab conquerors reasserted their independence. To reclaim these ter-
ritories Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (r. 685–705) sent 
Hajjaj bin Yousuf (661–714), governor of Iraq, to restore the caliphate’s 
rule over the northeast corner of the empire. General Qutaibah bin 
Muslim (d. 715) led the campaign in 699/700. He reconquered a large 
area of Transoxiana (located between the Oxus and Syr Darya Rivers in 
modern Uzbekistan) but was unable to defeat the Kabul Shahi. They 
reached a truce, exempting the kingdom from any tribute payments for 
seven years. Again, the Pakistan region escaped Arab domination and 
ongoing attention.

For the next three centuries (ca. 700–1000) Kabul, Peshawar, and 
Swat were settled by Afghan tribes who migrated from their ancestral 
lands west of the Sulaiman Range. At first the Kabul Shahi tried to 
drive the immigrants back. When that failed, the Shahi enlisted them 
in their battles with the Arabs and awarded the tribes villages between 
Kabul and Peshawar, in a region known as Lamghan, in return. The 
Afghanis constructed a fort in the Khyber Pass to block the advance 
of Arabs.

Arabs in Sind
As noted, the Arabs were familiar with the coast of the subcontinent, 
having sailed along its western shores plying a bustling trade with 
Ceylon (today’s Sri Lanka) for centuries. In addition to the challenge 
of the elements, pirates and hostile coastal kingdoms made the voyage 
perilous. At the mouth of the Indus River (called the Mehran by the 
Arabs), the port city of Debal served as the stronghold of the Meds, 
one such kingdom. Noted seafarers, they engaged in trade, fishing, and 
piracy and extorted seafarers for protection payments.

A Brief History of Pakistan

The Meds seized the ships of any who attempted to navigate the 
waters they claimed without paying for safe passage. In 710 news reached 
Arabia that Debal pirates had seized an Arab ship, stolen its cargo, and 
imprisoned its crew and passengers, Arab families returning home from 
a visit to Ceylon. Exacerbating the outrage, the ship had been carrying 
gifts from the king of Ceylon to Caliph Walid I (r. 705–715).

Hajjaj bin Yousuf, then governor of the Islamic empire’s eastern end, 
demanded the kingdom’s ruler, Raja Dahir (d. 712), pay for the ship 
and its cargo and free its passengers. Dahir claimed he held no sway 
with the pirates, and negotiations broke down. Two limited campaigns 
against Dahir subsequently failed. Finally Yousuf received permission 
for a major campaign against all of Sind. His young nephew, Muhammad 
bin Qasim (695–715), was given command.

The Campaigns of Muhammad bin Qasim
By age 15 Muhammad bin Qasim was one of his uncle’s most trusted 
assistants, from whom he received his education in warfare. At age 16 
he served under General Qutaibah bin Muslim, where he distinguished 
himself with his military planning. Six months of preparation preceded 
Qasim’s Sind campaign. Before commencing the assault, Qasim married 
his uncle’s daughter. His attack force included 6,000 Syrian horsemen, 
6,000 troops on camels, and 3,000 Bactrian camels to carry supplies. 
Ships carried five large catapults. The largest, called Uroos, Arabic for 
bride, required a force of 500 men to operate. A network of couriers was 
organized for battlefield communications.

The coastal strip of Makran was the first region of Sind attacked and 
the first to fall. Armabil (contemporary Bela in Baluchistan) was next. 
Joined by the troops from the previous two unsuccessful Arab attacks 
on the Hindu kingdom, Qasim set out for Debal on the Indus River 
delta, where a naval expedition from Basra (in present-day Iraq) was 
also directed. The sea and land forces arrived at Debal on the same day, 
the former having been about a month in transit. They dug trenches 
and awaited orders to attack.

Residents of Debal believed their gods would protect them as long 
as the flag waved from their central temple. Qasim, learning this, made 
the flag his primary target and had the catapult arm of Uroos shortened 
to hit the target. Debal’s flag was soon knocked down, the fortifications 
breached, and the town conquered, though its leader fled. Qasim issued 
a decree:

THE COMING OF ISLAM

All human beings are created by Allah and are equal in His eyes. 
He is one and without a peer. In my religion only those who are 
kind to fellow human beings are worthy of respect. Cruelty and 
oppression are prohibited in our law. We fight only those who 
are unjust and are enemies of the truth. (Hussain 1997, 103)

A treaty was promulgated by one of the officers: On behalf 
of the Commander of the Faithful, I, Habib bin Muslim, grant 
amnesty to all the people of Daibul [Debal] and hereby ensure 
their personal safety, security of their temples, women and 
children and their property. So long as you will pay jizya [a 
tax of protection levied on non-Muslims] we shall abide by this 
agreement. (Ibid.)

Hindu rule in the region had been marked by oppression and cruelty 
toward both the large Buddhist population and lower-caste Hindus. By 
their tolerance the Muslims, as they had in other conquered regions, 
soon won over the populace, who had little regard for their previous 
rulers.

Continuing the campaign, Qasim next attacked Neronkut, a pre-
dominantly Buddhist city farther upriver on the Indus, near pres-
ent-day Hyderabad, which was under the rule of Raja Dahir’s son, 
Prince Jay Singh. Siege equipment was loaded back on the ships 
and floated up the Indus. After a six-day march the troops arrived 
at the city. Dahir ordered his son to vacate the city and join him at 
Brahmanabad, leaving Neronkut in the command of a Buddhist priest 
who turned the city over to Qasim and provided fodder for the Arab’s 
camels and horses.

Qasim now marched on Sehwan, under the rule of Dahir’s cousin, 
Bhoj Rai. The city’s Buddhist community asked Bhoj to capitulate, 
but he attempted an attack on the rear of Qasim’s forces. While the 
Arabs planned their counterattack, the Buddhists secretly sent Qasim 
word that the commoners did not support Bhoj Rai and advised the 
Arab commander their army was largely ineffective and unready to 
fight. After another week of battle, Bhoj Rai fled. Qasim organized an 
Islamic administration of the conquered city. The fortress was later 
retaken by its former ruler, but was won back by Muhammad Khan, 
one of Qasim’s generals. Sehwan became a center of Islamic power in 
Sind.

With losses mounting, local rulers and governors began offering 
submission to Qasim and providing supplies for his army. Leaders who 
submitted were treated generously. All were allowed to continue prac-
ticing their religion.

A Brief History of Pakistan

Final Victories
Meanwhile, the Arab’s advance bogged down at the Indus. Blocked by 
Dahir’s son from crossing the river at Brahmanabad, the army encamped 
on its banks. After several weeks their supplies began to run out. Horses 
were slaughtered for food, and soldiers weakened from hunger. Qasim 
sent Yousuf a request for supplies and received 2,000 horses along with 
vinegar-soaked cotton, intended perhaps as a palliative for the rampant 
vitamin deficiency. The Arabs finally built a bridge of boats and after 50 
days crossed the Indus, making for Rawar, joined by more local rulers 
who switched sides against Dahir. In June of 713, following several days 
of skirmishes, Dahir, leading his forces from atop an elephant, came out 
to face Qasim in a battle that would decide the fate of Sind. Early in the 
battle a blazing arrow struck the trunk of Dahir’s elephant, setting its 
ornamental silk covering on fire. The panicked elephant ran, leaving 
Dahir’s abandoned forces frightened and confused. Returning to the 
battle on horseback, Dahir tried to lead his troops but was decapitated 
by an Arab swordsman. His army was routed by the Islamic army and 
their newfound local allies. After the battle the city of Rawar surren-
dered, as did Brahmanabad. But strongholds remained. The Multan fort 
resisted the Arabs’ months-long effort to conquer it. Finally the channel 
that supplied the fort with its water was discovered and cut off, and the 
fort surrendered. To secure the protection of their temple, the Multanis 
gave a fortune in treasure to Qasim, a sum large enough to help pay for 
the entire expedition. From here Qasim sent forces to Kashmiri strong-
holds on the Jhelum River and to the borders of the Kanauj kingdom 
in northern India.

During the campaign Yousuf died, as did Caliph Walid I soon after 
Multan had fallen. The new caliph, Sulaiman (r. 715–717), ceded power 
in the empire’s east to a rival Arab faction. Yousuf’s family members 
were now regarded as enemies by the new ruler. Qasim was recalled and 
executed before further advances were made. Nonetheless, Sind became 
Islam’s path (bab-al Islam, or door of Islam) to the subcontinent.

Sind after Muhammad bin Qasim
Despite the halt in the advance of the Arab forces, for the next 200 
years Sind remained part of the Islamic Empire, under the direction of 
at least 37 Arab governors who oversaw the administrations of local 
rulers. Islam spread while Buddhists and Hindus continued to prac-
tice their faith. Local revenue officials collected jizya and zakat (a tax 
on Muslims). Mosques sprouted in every city, joining the Hindu and 

48

THE COMING OF ISLAM

Buddhist temples and shrines. Disputes between Muslims were settled 
by qadis, Islamic judges, according to Islamic law. Disputes between 
Buddhists and Hindus were settled by Brahman priests of the local pan-
chayat, or council. Over time the Islamic and Sindi customs intertwined 
to create a new culture. Underscoring the deep bond that grew, Sindi 
became the first language into which the Qur’an was translated.

Some 10 years after Qasim’s conquests, Junaid, an Arab governor, 
tried to expand Sind’s empire to the east by annexing Kutch, the coastal 
area between the mouth of the Indus and the Gulf of Kutch, and Malwa. 
But in 738 the Arabs were defeated at the Battle of Rajasthan by the 
Pratihara Rajputs of the Thar Desert. A northward expansion into 
Punjab from Multan was halted with Kashmiri help under the leader-
ship of Laladitya (724–760), one of Kashmir’s greatest rulers. Laladitya 
maintained an alliance with the Tang dynasty in China, as did Turkish 
Shahi rulers in Kabul who sought allies against the Arabs.

The Arabs were not the only force seeking to gain territory in the 
region. Tibet ruled much of Nepal, northern India, and what is now 
Bangladesh. In about 726 Tibet conquered Skardu, which lay to Gilgit’s 
east. Seeking to counter their growing power, in 747 the Chinese sent 
troops to southern Chitral, an area in modern northwest Pakistan, 
where they replaced the pro-Tibet ruler, putting his brother, who was 
closer to the Chinese, on the throne. But Tibet’s westward expansion 
continued, finally winning dominance over the Gilgit Valley and upper 
Chitral.

Such was the importance of maintaining strong ties with China that 
before the leader of Kabul and Swat passed rule to his son, he sought 
approval from China. Underscoring China’s interest in defending its 
flank, China also granted the son the title “Brave General Guarding the 
Left” in approving the succession.

Meanwhile the resurgent Arabs resumed efforts to expand their 
empire in Central Asia. The conflict between the Arabs and Chinese for 
control of this area ended at the Battle of Talas in 751, with the Arabs 
emerging victorious. In the aftermath most of the Turkish nomads 
who had settled in the region converted to Islam. Yet despite the Arab 
victory, the area encompassing Gandhara, Swat, and Kabul remained 
largely independent.

The Abbasids
By this time the caliphate, the office of the political and spiritual ruler 
of the Islamic Empire, had moved to Baghdad, and the Abbasid dynasty

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

of caliphs was in power. It was under the Abbasids that the intellectual 
flowering called the Golden Age of Islam took place. The Golden Age 
reached its height during the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-
Rashid (r. 786–809). His death created unrest throughout the empire, 
as local rulers sought to assert independence while his sons Muhammad 
al-Amin (r. 809–813) and Abdullah al-Mamun (r. 813–833) fought for 
control of the empire. While the two were thus occupied, the governor 
of Transoxiana proclaimed his independence, backed by allies including 
Qarluq Turks, the Shahi of Kabul, and the Tibetan empire. Al-Mamun 
finally prevailed in the struggle for succession and quickly dispatched 
forces to subdue Transoxiana’s rebellious ruler and his allies.

In 817 the Arab forces captured Kabul’s ruler, Ispabadh Shah, at 
Merv, in present-day Turkmenistan. Taken to Baghdad and brought 
before the caliph, the shah converted to Islam. His successor as lagatur-
man, another title by which Kabul’s rulers were known, was allowed to 
rule the Kabul region, but was assessed twice the normal tribute, which 
he paid to the governor of Khorasan, the Islamic Empire’s northeastern 
frontier state.

A second campaign sent Muslim troops to upper Chitral as far as the 
Indus River to forestall future attacks from Tibet. Here they planted the 
black flags of the Abbasid caliphate.

In suppressing local rebellions throughout the empire, al-Mamun 
came to rely on several generals. In Khorasan the general who directed 
al-Mamun’s victory over his brother, Tahir ibn Husain (d. 822), a Persian 
by birth, was so effective he became the de facto ruler of the region, 
though he continued to swear fealty to the caliph. Like Tahir himself, 
his troops were primarily Persian Muslims. This marked the first time 
the Islamic Empire came to depend on non-Arabs for its security. 
The increasing reliance on non-Arab Muslims would have a dramatic 
impact on the empire, as eventually these military leaders took over the 
empire while retaining the Abbasid caliphs as figureheads. The Turks in 
particular, as a result of the Abbasid practice of capturing Turkish boys 
and educating and training them in the military arts, would come to 
occupy premier positions in the Abbasid power structure.

However, in the late ninth century Tahir’s successors lost control of 
the territory to a Muslim coppersmith from Sistan (now eastern Iran), 
Yaqub bin Laith (r. ca. 867–879). Unable to defeat Yaqub, the Tahirid 
governor gave him authority over eastern Persia and Afghanistan, creat-
ing the Saffarid (from saffar, coppersmith) Emirate.

In 870/1 Yaqub attacked and defeated the Hindu Shahi ruler of 
Kabul, even though Kabul was nominally a suzerain of the Islamic

THE COMING OF ISLAM

THE REGION’S PART IN 
ISLAM’S GOLDEN AGE

The region that is now Pakistan played a prominent role in the 
era of inquiry and discovery known as the Golden Age of Islam. 

Numerous works that had been created in what is now Pakistan 
when it was part of the Sassanian Persian Empire (224–651) were 
now translated from Pahlawi into Arabic. This includes the tale of 
Sinbad the Sailor, later collected in A Thousand and One Nights. Chess, 
which became popular throughout the Arab world, also originated in 
the Indian subcontinent and came to Persia under the Sassanians. A 
family from Punjab, the Barmakids, played a key role in the transfer of 
knowledge from the region to the Islamic Empire. Originally Buddhist 
priests, the Barmakids were masters of the medical arts. They settled 
in Balkh, along the current Afghan-Uzbekistan border, and converted 
to Islam. Later they became secretaries and advisers to the Abbasid 
caliphs until they lost power in 803.

A raid against Kashmir by the governor of Sind during this time 
brought the famous Sanskrit scholar Mankha to Baghdad. After study-
ing its tenets, Mankha converted to Islam and thereafter spent his 
life translating works from Sanskrit into Arabic. Mathematics also 
benefi ted from Islam’s exposure to India. What are commonly called 
Arabic numerals in the West originated in a numbering system from 
the subcontinent. The numeral zero was part of this system and was 
probably invented centuries earlier in the Taxila region. Some 700 
years later this knowledge passed to the Western world during the 
Renaissance.

Empire. To win favor, Yaqub sent treasures back to the Abbasid caliph 
in Baghdad. In return the caliph extended Yaqub’s authority over all of 
Persia and Sind. For the next decade Yaqub appointed the governor of 
the Hindu Shahi kingdom. By 876 Yaqub was threatening the Abbasid 
caliphate itself. He marched his army to Baghdad but was defeated near 
the city. Though not routed, Saffarid power began to decline. By 903 his 
descendants’ rule was again confined to Sistan.

Another Persian group, the Samanids, composed of nobles and 
landowners, played a large role in pushing the Saffarids back to 
Sistan. For their service the caliph ceded them rule of eastern Muslim 
territories including Persia and Afghanistan. Samanid rule lasted

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

from 903 to 999 and marked a rare period of tranquility and prosper-
ity in Central Asia.

With the Saffarids gone, by 900 the Kabul Valley was free of Muslim 
governance, and the Hindu Shahis’ rule was restored. The Hindu Shahi 
dynasty had been founded by the Brahman minister Kallar in 843. The 
Turk Shahis who preceded him had been mostly Buddhists. Kallar had 
moved the capital east from Kabul to Ohind, seat of one of the Hindu 
kingdoms that dominated the region, on the west bank of the Indus 
River, near present-day Attock. Ohind had historically been a major 
crossing point of the river. With Central Asian trade routes now under 
Arab control, overland trade again flourished, and the city became an 
important trade city. Here precious gems, textiles, perfumes, and other 
goods made their way west from the northern subcontinent. Illustrating 
the importance the region played in international trade of the era, coins 
minted by the Shahis have been found throughout the subcontinent, 
Central Asia, and even eastern Europe. The city also became a center 
of education and culture. But education at this time was confined to 
preservation rather than expansion of knowledge. Great Hindu temples 
were built by the Shahis and filled with idols, many of them later taken 
by Arab raiders. Some of their temples can still be seen in the Salt Range 
at Nandana, Malot, Siv Ganga, and Ketas. Ruins of these shrines are also 
on the west bank of the Indus, while the remains of old fortresses dot 
the hills of Swat.

While the Hindu Shahi kingdom flourished in the northwest of 
present-day Pakistan in Sind and Makran, small Muslim kingdoms 
developed. Mansurah and Multan were the two main principalities. 
The ruins of Mansurah attest to its former grandeur, while the Hebadi 
dynasty of Multan was well known for its devotion to learning and the 
welcome it gave scholars.

Kashmir’s power continued to grow during this period, and it came 
to control parts of Punjab. The Hindu Shahi kingdoms formed an alli-
ance to block any further Kashmiri expansion. Under Jayapala Shahi 
(r. 964–1001), the most celebrated Hindu Shahi ruler, the Hindu Shahi 
kingdom extended from west of Kabul to east of the present Pakistan-
India border, and in the north from the valleys of Bajaur, Buner, and 
southern Kashmir to Multan in the south.

Islam’s Second Wave
For some 350 years Islamic rule in what is now Pakistan and India was 
confined to small areas or exercised through local vassals. But begin-

ning in the 11th century, after campaigns of conquest waged by Muslim 
rulers from Central Asia, direct Islamic rule would extend over large 
swaths of the subcontinent.

The Hindu Shahi kingdom’s western border abutted Ghazni, ruled by 
Turkish Muslims and their king, Sebüktigin (r. 977–997). Seeking to 
expand his kingdom, Jayapala, the Hindu shahi, raised an army and 
marched on Ghazni. After days of battle the Turkish Muslims had 
gained the upper hand. Sebüktigin accepted Jayapala’s promise of 
money, territory, and elephants in exchange for peace. But Jayapala 
reneged on the agreement, incarcerating the Turkish officers sent 
along to assure his compliance. Sebüktigin marched his army in pur-
suit, burning temples and destroying property along the way. Though 
outnumbered by Jayapala’s massive force, skillful deployment of the 
Turkish cavalry earned victory for the Muslims The defeated Jayapala 
ultimately committed suicide.

Mahmud of Ghazni
Sebüktigin was succeeded by his son, Mahmud of Ghazni (r. 998–1030). 
Under Mahmud the Ghaznis extended their rule into non-Islamic 
northern India, adding great wealth to their kingdom. Concurrently 
Islam spread throughout the region and became the dominant social 
and political force in what is now Pakistan.

By this time the Islamic Empire had split into rival caliphates: the 
Abbasids, who ruled from Baghdad, and the Fatimids in Cairo, whose 
hereditary rulers claimed legitimacy to the caliphate through their 
descent from Fatima, daughter of the prophet Muhammad. Multan had 
been under the control of Fatimid loyalists. Mahmud, who supported 
the Abbasids, attacked and defeated Multan and its Hindu allies. He 
also continued his battles against the Hindu Shahi dynasty, which grad-
ually lost ground, from 1000 to 1026. In 1001 he conquered Peshawar, 
and it became an important center of the empire. As he conducted his 
military campaigns, Mahmud also built his capital of Ghazni into the 
greatest city east of Baghdad. The Persian scholar al-Beruni (973–1048) 
accompanied Mahmud back to Ghazni after his conquest and annexa-
tion of Khorasan and also on campaigns in the subcontinent, becoming 
the first Muslim scholar to study Indian society and languages.

For nearly 200 years Mahmud and his successors ruled what is 
now Pakistan. During the Ghaznavid period Muslim missionaries

Central Asia. (Borromeo/Art Resource, NY)

and scholars traveled throughout the kingdom spreading the prophet 
Muhammad’s message. One of the first, Shaikh Ismail Bohkari, began 
preaching in Lahore in 1005. Islam was embraced by more Afghan 
tribesmen as well as the Janjuas rajputs of the Salt Range and others in 
the Punjab. Gradually it was accepted throughout the population.

Today Mahmud is considered a hero in Pakistan but reviled in India 
for forcing Hindus and Buddhists to convert to Islam and for the sack-
ing and plundering of Hindu temples.

In 1018 Mahmud conquered Kanauj, marking the end of the Gurjara-
Pratihara dynasty. The Pratiharas were superseded by another Rajput 
clan, the Rathors, who ruled under Mahmud and his successors.

With the stability wrought by the Ghaznavids, trade along the silk 
routes in Punjab that had been disrupted by warfare among local king-
doms revived. Ghazni became an important trade center, and Mahmud 
minted coins to facilitate commerce. Among Hindus trade had always 
been an occupation of the lower castes. But with the growing profits, by 
1030 Brahmans were also involved in mercantile activities.

THE COMING OF ISLAM

Masud I
Mahmud was succeeded by his eldest son, Masud (r. 1031–41), who 
reorganized the administration in Lahore, a Ghaznavid vassal state, to 
assure control over the new territories. Masud sought to keep Muslim 
leaders separate from their Hindu subjects without alienating the masses. 
He instructed Turkish officers not to drink, play polo, or socialize with 
Hindu officers, nor display religious intolerance toward them. When the 
governor of Lahore raided Banares (modern Varanasi) and failed to give 
Masud any of the spoils, Masud showed his own tolerance by selecting 
a Hindu general, Tilak, to lead a retaliatory attack on Lahore.

However, the empire began to crumble. Multan regained its indepen-
dence after Mahmud’s death and again allied itself with the Fatimids. 
The western part of the empire began to fall to the Seljuks, the Turkish 
mercenaries who had taken the reins of the Abbasid caliphate. Masud’s 
father, Mahmud, had always kept a Seljuk prince as a hostage to gain 
leverage over the Turks. But a hostage was insufficient to deter them 
now. The Seljuks continued their onslaught, and at the Battle of Merv 
(1040) they drove the Ghaznavids from Khorasan. Masud was prepared 
to accept defeat, but his own Turkish troops rejected his submissive 
attitude and, during their retreat, rebelled at the Indus River crossing 
at Ohind. Masud was arrested along with his wife and some followers, 
and a month later he was beheaded.

After Masud
The Ghaznavid dynasty survived Masud’s execution. While the Seljuks 
assimilated their gains in Khorasan, Masud’s son Maudud (r. 1042–49) 
defeated Masud’s younger brother to take control of the empire. During 
Maudud’s reign three Hindu rajas made repeated attempts to drive 
the Ghaznavids from the Punjab. The Hindus succeeded in regaining 
Kangra and Thanesar but were thwarted at Lahore during their siege. A 
Turkish marksman killed the Hindus’ leader, and his troops withdrew 
in disarray. Maudud later sent one of his sons to oversee Peshawar, and 
another to run Lahore.

During this period southeastern Sind was ruled by the Sumras, one 
of the first clans to accept Islam following Qasim’s campaigns. They 
assisted the Arabs in their governance of Sind, though they later devel-
oped an allegiance to the Fatimids. By the mid-11th century they had 
assumed independent rule of southeastern Sind, making their capital 
at Kutch. More than a score of Sumra rulers presided over the Sumra 
kingdom over the next two centuries.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Ghaznavid rule in what is today northern Pakistan continued under 
Ibrahim (r. 1059–99) and his son Masud III (r. 1099–1115). Though 
the Seljuks had increased their power in the Islamic Empire, treaties 
with them kept the western flank of the Ghaznavid kingdom secure. 
Lahore became a major cultural center in the Muslim world during this 
time. Among its important figures was Syed Ali Ibn Usman of Havver, 
also known as Data Ganj Bakhsh (d. 1077). A noted Muslim theolo-
gian, he wrote poetry and scholarly works, helping spread Islam in the 
region. His treatise on Sufism was the standard text on the subject for 
centuries. His former home in Lahore is still visited by thousands annu-
ally. Lahore’s prominence as a center of learning and the arts continued 
into the reign of Ibrahim’s grandson, Shirzad (r. 1115).

The Ghurids
In a region called Ghur, the desolate hill country south of Herat, 
Afghanistan, a blood feud precipitated by Bahram Shah (1118–52), 
the ruler of Ghazni, gave birth to a new kingdom that would sup-
plant Ghaznavid rule. Bahram executed a prince of Ghur, provoking 
one of the prince’s brothers to attack Ghazni and force Bahram into a 
temporary retreat. When Bahram again set upon the Ghurid forces, he 
captured the Ghur prince who had led the assault and barbarously put 
him to death. The remaining Ghurid princes, determined to avenge the 
deaths of their brothers, mounted an overwhelming attack on Bahram’s 
kingdom in 1150/1, completely destroying Ghazni and earning their 
leader the honorific Jahan-Soz, or Earth Burner. The Ghaznis moved 
their capital to Lahore.

The Ghurids, now independent of Ghazni rule, attacked Herat but 
were defeated by the Seljuk governor. But in 1153 the Seljuks fell 
to another Turkish tribe, the Ghuzz, who went on to conquer most 
of Afghanistan, including Ghazni. After 1160 the Ghuzz kept the 
Ghaznavids confined to what is today northern Pakistan.

In 1173 the Ghurid ruler, Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Muhammad, assisted 
by his younger brother, drove the Ghuzz from the Ghazni region. The 
younger brother, Muhammad of Ghur (1162–1206), began raiding 
the subcontinent, using the Gomal Pass as his transit point. In 1175 
Muhammad of Ghur occupied Multan and Uch (near present-day 
Bahawalpur). Following in the footsteps of Mahmud of Ghazni, he 
set out across the Thar Desert in Rajputana to raid Gujarat. He was 
defeated by Chalukya Raja of Kathiawar (today’s northwest India) in 
1178. Bloodied but unbowed, Muhammad of Ghur attacked Ghaznavid

lands, taking Peshawar in 1179. He defeated both the Gakkars, power-
ful tribes that lived in the hill country between the upper Indus and 
Jhelum Rivers, and the Ghaznavid ruler Khusrau Malik (r. 1160–87), 
taking Sialkot in 1185 and occupying Lahore in 1186/7. Muhammad’s 
conquest of Lahore marked the end of the Ghaznavid dynasty.

In 1190/1 Muhammad conquered Bhatinda, India, in the territory 
of the Chauhan. But once Muhammad set off to return to Ghazni, 
the Chauhan ruler, Raja Prithviraj (1165–92), sent forces to retake 
the fortress at Bhatinda. Muhammad reversed his course and met 
Raja Prithviraj’s army at Tarain (also Taraori, near the present-day 
city of Thanesar, India). Muhammad’s forces lost the battle, though 
Muhammad survived. Seeking revenge, he returned in 1192. At the 
Second Battle of Tarain, Muhammad captured Prithviraj and completely 
routed his numerically superior forces. The victory opened northern 
India to Muslim conquest. The raja’s queen and attendants immolated 
themselves in the style of defeated Rajput women. Delhi was now under 
Muslim rule, as it would remain for more than 650 years, the capital 
of a series of powerful Muslim dynasties, until the last Mughal was 
deposed by the British.

By 1203 Muhammad had established Ghurid rule of the Ganges 
River basin. From his capital in Firoz Koh in Ghur, Afghanistan, he 
ruled over much of the subcontinent, sharing power with his older 
brother. To the west lay Khwarezm, extending from Persia into Central 
Asia, ruled by a Turkish Muslim dynasty. Shortly before his death in 
1206, Muhammad failed to defeat the shah of Khwarezm, Ala-ud-Din 
Muhammad II (r. 1200–20, d. 1231) in battle. He was assassinated in 
his sleep, bringing the Ghurid empire to its end. The shah of Khwarezm 
gained control of all of Transoxiana (Turkestan), then conquered the 
Ghurid territories west of the Indus. Muhammad of Ghur’s governors 
established independent fiefdoms east of the river. A top Ghurid gen-
eral, Qutb-ud-Din Aibak (r. 1206–10), or Aybak, who had conquered 
and been appointed governor of Delhi, made that city his capital. He 
founded the first of a series of Muslim dynasties that would be known 
as the Delhi Sultanate.

The Delhi Sultanate
The Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526) established Islamic rule throughout 
much of the subcontinent, and it maintained its predominance in the 
region for more than three centuries. The sultanate’s formative period, 
1206–90, is often called the Slave dynasty because the rulers of this era

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

were Turkish generals who began their lives as slaves. They took the 
title sultan.

The Slave Dynasty
Qutb-ud-Din Aibak, the first sultan of Delhi and the first Muslim ruler 
to make his capital in India, was born in Transoxiana. Captured and 
sold into slavery as a child, he received a good education and was 
schooled in archery and horsemanship. Upon the death of his owner, 
the chief qadi of Nishapur, in Khorasan, Aibak was sold to Muhammad 
Ghuri, eventually becoming his most trusted general. Aibak conquered 
much of northern India during the Ghurid campaigns of conquest. A 
builder as well as battler, he constructed mosques in Delhi and Ajmer, 
Rajasthan. Aibak was in Lahore subduing a Gakkar uprising when 
Muhammad died, and he established his capital in that city before mov-
ing it to Delhi. He died in an accident while playing polo in 1210.

SUFISM

Sufi sm developed in the 10th century as a reaction to the increased 
worldliness of Islam in the aftermath of the empire’s expansion 

and growing secularism. It was enthusiastically adopted in the Sind 
and Punjab. Sufi s practiced asceticism and eschewed the trappings of 
materialism. The populations in these regions were familiar with these 
practices, as they had a history of asceticism under Buddhists. By the 
13th century Multan and Uch were fl ourishing centers of both trade 
and Sufi sm, drawing many merchants, Sufi s, and scholars. Here Sufi  
saints and Muslim trade and craft guilds were closely linked. Indeed, 
during Iltutmish’s reign, Multan became the site of the fi rst Sufi  center, 
or khanqah, established by Shaikh Bahand-din Zakariyya, or Baha-ud-
din Zakariyya (ca. 1170–1267). He introduced the Suhrawardi order of 
Sufi sm to the subcontinent. The Suhrawardis were fervent proselytiz-
ers, responsible for converting many Hindus to Islam.

The Chistiyya order of Sufi s was the second to establish a khanqah. 
The order was founded in Chist, a village near Herat, Afghanistan, 
by Khwaja Muin-ud-din Chisti (b. ca. 1141–1236). By the time of his 
death Chistiyya khanqahs had been founded throughout the Delhi 
Sultanate. Baba Farid Shakar Gunj, or Farid-ud-din Ganjshakar (ca. 
1180–1266), his successor, is considered the fi rst great poet of the 
Punjabi language.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Aibak was briefly succeeded by his son, Aram Shah (r. 1210–11), 
but owing to his reputed laziness and incompetence, Turkish officers 
deposed him in favor of Aibak’s son-in-law, Shams-ud-Din, who ruled 
under the name Iltutmish (r. 1211–36). Iltutmish was faced with insur-
rections throughout the empire, but methodically took on the young 
sultanate’s former vassals and then began expanding the empire’s terri-
tory. He defeated Taj-ud-Din Yalduz, or Yulduz, in Lahore in 1215 and 
Nasir-ud-Din Qubacha (r. 1206–28), who ruled Multan, upper Sind, 
and portions of Punjab, in 1215 and again in 1228. Both these foes 
were former slave generals who served under Muhammad of Ghazni, 
as had Iltutmish’s father-in-law, Aibak, founder of the Delhi Sultanate. 
The Khalji in Bengal, a kingdom also founded by slave generals for-
merly allied with Aibak, were defeated after Iltutmish mounted three 
campaigns against them. The Abbasid caliphate recognized Iltutmish’s 
rule and sent envoys to Delhi from Baghdad in 1229. By the time of his 
death in 1236, the Delhi Sultanate’s territory was consolidated.

Mongols on the Doorstep
Under the reign of Iltutmish the sultanate—and the region that is 
now Pakistan—contended with the depredations of armies of Mongol 
nomads that swept into the region led by Chinggis, or Genghis Khan, 
(ca. 1162–1227). Chinggis Khan and the Mongols first came to the 
area in 1221 in pursuit of Jalal–ud-Din Mengüberdi, son of the shah 
of Khwarezm, Ala-ud-Din Muhammad II. The Mongols had overrun 
Khwarezm in 1220. Ala-ud-Din Muhammad had escaped but died 
soon after, and Mengüberdi (r. 1220–31) fled east with a small army. 
The Mongols caught and defeated them at the Battle of the Indus. 
Mengüberdi and some of his followers escaped into India. Chinggis 
Khan continued into the subcontinent as well, plundering and sacking 
his way through Punjab and Multan. Iltutmish is said to have declined 
Mengüberdi’s request for sanctuary in Delhi.

By the end of Iltutmish’s reign the Mongols controlled much of what 
is now Pakistan as well as most of Central Asia and parts of Europe. 
Now that the silk routes were under their jurisdiction, the Mongols 
switched from raiding caravans to taxing them. In the Pakistan region, 
towns west of the Indus submitted to Mongol rule while the Delhi 
Sultanate claimed all lands east of the river. Local rulers in the Indus 
region tried to remain neutral.

After the death of Chinggis Khan the Mongol empire split into four 
parts. Present-day Pakistan came to be known as Chaghatai, named after 

60

THE COMING OF ISLAM

the descendants of Chaghatai, Chinggis Khan’s second son. Mongol raids 
continued to ravage the region, ultimately depopulating the provinces of 
today’s Baluchistan and NWFP. Marco Polo (1254–1324) was held pris-
oner here, and after his escape wrote of the Chaghatai: “They know well 
the localities . . . they come here by the dozen thousands, sometimes 
more, sometimes less. Once they seize a plain, no one escapes, neither 
men nor cattle. If they make their mind to plunder, there is nothing that 
they cannot take hold of. When they take a folk in captivity they slay the 
old and take away the young whom they sell as slaves” (Hussain 1997, 
145). The raids also drew Baluchi and Afghan tribes into the western 
Pakistan area, as the land was now emptied, introducing two important 
ethnic groups into the population of Pakistan.

On the east side of the Indus Iltutmish was succeeded by his daugh-
ter Razia Sultana (r. 1236–40). But military leaders were unwilling 
to recognize her rule. Turkish nobles rebelled against her and seized 
power, but were unable to agree on a leader. Iltutmish’s youngest son, 
Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud (r. 1246–66), was his last descendant to rule 
the sultanate. He spent most of his time in prayer, turning the affairs of 
the state over to a Turkish slave, Ghiyas ud Din Balban, who gradually 
gained control of the empire. Balban (r. 1266–87) took the throne upon 
Nasir-ud-Din’s death.

The sultanate had grown in part due to the ambitious corps of 
Turkish officers that led its military victories. Their contributions 
were reflected in the rule by consensus previous sultans had observed. 
Balban dispensed with this practice and shifted composition of the 
military garrisons from Turkish to Afghan forces, lessening the chances 
of an attempted coup by these officers. Concurrently he introduced 
pomp and ceremony into the state’s affairs. From his subjects’ point 
of view, his major contribution was the construction of forts from 
the Indus to Delhi, built to protect the region from the Mongols. He 
also rebuilt towns and villages throughout Punjab the marauders had 
destroyed, including the reconstruction of Lahore. Balban’s eldest and 
most capable son, Muhammad, governor of Multan and Sind, engaged 
the Mongols successfully in several skirmishes, but died in battle.

Balban was succeeded by his inexperienced and undisciplined 18-
year-old grandson, Muiz ud din Qaiqabad (r. 1286–90). Four years 
later, after suffering a debilitating stroke, Qaiqabad named his three-
year-old son Kayumars (r. 1290) as ruler in his stead. A group of 
Turkish nobles asked Jalal-ud-din Firuz Khalji (r. 1290–96) to step in, 
and the elderly general accepted. But the sultanate was in decline, as it 
had been since the reign of Iltutmish. The corps of ambitious Turkish

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

officers who helped create the kingdom now gave in to avarice over the 
spoils of the dynasty’s demise, further fragmenting the empire. Some 
resented the increasing power of the Khalji clan, considered to be of 
Afghan rather than Turkish origin.

The Khalji Dynasty
The Delhi Sultanate continued battling the Mongols after the fall of 
the Slave Dynasty. By the time Jalal-ud-Din Khalji took the throne, he 
had spent years battling the Mongols. Now old and nonthreatening, 
he was unable to keep either his officers or the Mongols in check. He 
appointed his battle-hardened and ruthless nephew Ala-ud-Din Khalji 
as governor. Later Ala-ud-Din Khalji (r. 1296–1316) succeeded him to 
the throne. Battles with and victories against the Mongols marked his 
rule.

Soon after Ala-ud-Din assumed rule, Punjab was invaded by an army 
of 100,000 Mongols. Ala-ud-Din drove off this first wave. A year later 
the Mongols returned and captured Sehwan, but Ala-ud-Din reclaimed 
the city, capturing thousands of Mongols and their leader. In 1299 the 
Mongols laid siege to Delhi. Advisors urged Ala-ud-Din to make peace 
with the Mongols, but he refused: “If I were to follow your advice, how 
could I show my face, how could I go into my harem, what store would 
the people set by me?” (Hussain 1997, 151). Instead he attacked and 
defeated the Mongol army.

An able administrator as well as warrior, Ala-ud-Din reorganized 
the state, ending local insurrections by reorganizing local rule and 
creating a centrally paid army that could stave off Mongol attacks 
anywhere in the kingdom. Ultimately he drove the Mongols from all 
of Pakistan and carried the war to their strongholds, pillaging Kabul, 
Ghazni, and Kandahar. Ala-ud-Din also conquered the Sumra kingdom 
and expanded Muslim rule deep into the subcontinent. Expeditions in 
1307, 1309, and 1313 brought victories as far as the tip of the Deccan 
peninsula. Local rulers held their positions but paid tribute to Delhi.

Ala-ud-Din’s conquest of southern India brought an infusion of new 
cultural elements into the Delhi Sultanate. Artisans and craftsmen from 
the conquered areas flocked to the prosperous cities of the kingdom. 
This infusion resulted in cultural advances that included the sitar, pur-
portedly invented by Amir Khusro, or Khusrau, Dehlawi (1253–1325), 
a Muslim intent on creating a separate Islamic art tradition based on the 
subcontinent’s own cultural roots. The stringed instrument was derived 
from the Persian tanpura and the South Indian vina. Amir Khusro is 
also credited with inventing the tabla (“drum” in Arabic), a percussion

THE COMING OF ISLAM

instrument based on the South Indian drum. (Amir Khusro makes no 
mention of creating these instruments in his own writings.)

A long illness compromised Ala-ud-Din’s administrative and leader-
ship capabilities, and he ceded control of the empire to his general, 
Malik Kafur, a former Hindu slave. Confusion reigned after Ala-ud-
Din’s death until 1320, when Punjab’s governor, Ghias-ud-Din Tughluq, 
accepted the request of Muslim nobles to take the throne.

The Tughluq Dynasty
A former governor of Punjab, Ghias-ud-Din Tughluq (r. 1320–25) 
reasserted the power of the sultanate in Delhi, the Deccan, and Bengal, 
which had ebbed while Al-ud-Din focused on his southern conquests. 
A bold general and able administrator, he reversed some of Ala-ud-Din’s 
unpopular policies, granting iqtadars—local administrators who raised 
land revenues and maintained troops for the sultanate—greater control 
over their lands and lower tribute payments. His short reign ended 
when he died in the collapse of a poorly built pavilion.

Muhammad ibn Tughluq (r. 1325–51), Ghias-ud-Din’s son, was 
similar to Ala-ud-Din in his ruthlessness and ambition, but unthink-
ing in his application of those traits. He reimposed the unpopular 
local governance policies of Ala-ud-Din that his father had reversed. 
To exercise greater control over the Deccan, he moved the capital from 
Delhi to Deogir, renaming it Daulatabad, and ordered all inhabitants to 
move from Delhi to the new capital. Many died during the trip south. 
Ibn Tughluq also planned to have all the inhabitants of Multan move 
south. When the governor refused, Ibn Tughluq came to the city and 
demanded that all its citizens be put to death. The inhabitants were later 
pardoned after the intercession of Shah Rukn-e-Alam (1251–1335), 
an influential cleric whose mausoleum is today one of Multan’s most 
famed edifices. In 1347 Ibn Tughluq restored Delhi as the sultanate’s 
capital and allowed people to return to the city.

Ibn Tughluq’s attempt to introduce a new copper and brass currency 
was a failure. He raised a large army, intending to mount a campaign 
against Khorasan, under the rule of Persian-allied Muslim rulers, and 
Tibet in the north, possibly to gain gold and horses, as rebellions were 
reducing the kingdom’s income. However, he was unable to follow 
through on his plans. Natural disaster added to his people’s misery. A 
drought during the years 1335–42, one of the worst in the subconti-
nent’s history, caused widespread famine and led to a revolt, despite Ibn 
Tughluq’s efforts to provide relief.

A Brief History of Pakistan

Where his father and grandfather had been content to leave local 
rulers in place and collect tribute, Ibn Tughluq tried to institute direct 
governance, a policy that provoked rebellions. Hindu rajas created an 
alliance to resist Delhi rule. By 1344 tribute payments in the Deccan 
were off 90 percent. An independent sultanate in the south, the Bahmani 
Sultanate, was formed in 1347 by Muslims who remained in the Deccan 
after Ibn Tughluq restored Delhi as the empire’s capital. That same year 
Gujarat and Kathiawar revolted, uprisings that Ibn Tughluq success-
fully suppressed.

In 1349 the Sammas, a group of Muslim chiefs, seized power from 
the Sumras. Both the Sumras and Sammas are thought to have origi-
nally been Hindu Rajputs. Though they were now Muslims, they kept 
pre-Islamic names. Sammas territory encompassed Sind and parts of 
Baluchistan and Punjab, and its capital was Thatta. Ibn Tughluq set 

Daulatabad Fort guarded Daulatabad, the city that Muhammad ibn Tughluq tried to make 
the capital of the Tughluq dynasty.  (SEF/Art Resource, NY)

off for the capital where the Sammas had given a rebel chief sanctuary. 
But during the expedition Ibn Tughluq took ill near Thatta and died in 
1351.

With Ibn Tughluq’s death no suitable descendant of Ala-ud-Din 
existed to take the throne. A group of nobles and religious leaders 
invited Firuz Tughluq (r. 1351–88), a cousin of Ibn Tughluq, to take 
the throne. He accepted the appointment, and one of his first acts was 
to withdraw the army from Sind. Firuz became known for his concern 
for his subjects and their welfare. Taxes were lowered and the empire’s 
infrastructure repaired and expanded. Sind was now basically indepen-
dent, though in a display of fealty rulers sent a prince to the Delhi court 
as a resident. In the decade after Firuz’s death at age 80 in 1388, eight 
different Tughluq kings ruled the sultanate, which had seen its hold 
over the territories loosen during the Firuz reign. Mahmud Nasir-ud-
Din Tughluq (r. 1395–98) was the last of the Tughluq sultans. During 
his reign the Gakkar chief Shaikha created an independent state in 
Punjab and for a time extended his territory to include Lahore. Nasir-
ud-Din’s rule ended when he was temporarily driven from Delhi by a 
new invader from Central Asia: Timur Lenk.

During this time the power of the Mongols, like that of the sultanate, 
was weakening. By 1320 almost all the Mongols had been driven from 
their former stronghold in Transoxiana. In 1369 a Turkish chief, Timur

minor chief, as a young man he had received a leg wound that gave 
him a permanent limp, and he was called Timur Lenk (the lame), 
anglicized into Tamerlane. A devout Muslim, he sought to conquer all 
Mongol lands for Islam. But his ambitions were not limited to retaking 
Mongol holdings. After conquering lands in Persia and Russia, in 1397 
he invaded the subcontinent. He took Delhi from Mahmud Tughluq in 
1398 and sacked the city, then withdrew to his capital at Samarkand, 
modern Uzbekistan, from where he administered the territory.

Mahmud Tughluq returned to the throne of Delhi after Timur’s 
departure and occupied it until his death in 1413. However, the 
Tughluq dynasty is considered to have ended with Timur’s conquest of 
Delhi. During Mahmud’s final years the sultanate continued to disinte-
grate, and governors declared their independence.

By the end of the short-lived Sayyid dynasty (1414–51), which suc-
ceeded the Tughluq dynasty, the sultanate’s dominion was basically con-
fined to Delhi and its immediate surroundings. During the rule of its 
last ruler, Alam Shah (r. 1444–51), Multan claimed independence, but 
the attempt by Multan’s populace to name their own ruler was thwarted 
when a local Afghan chief, Rai Siphera, or Sarha Langa, staged a coup, 
founding the Langa dynasty of Multan, which survived for 80 years.

The last dynasty to rule the Delhi Sultanate was the Lodi dynasty 
(1451–1526). Bahlul Lodi (r. 1451–89) restored the sultanate’s author-
ity in much of the northern subcontinent. But Multan remained inde-
pendent, despite Lodi’s efforts to conquer it. He finally recognized its 
ruler, Hussain Langha (1456–1502), the son of Sarha Langa, under 
whom Multan expanded its territory.

Once again the Delhi Sultanate declined. But this time it would not 
recover. By about 1500 independent Muslim kingdoms had arisen in 
Multan, Gujarat, Malwa, Sind, and Khandesh, in central India. With the 
death of Ibrahiml Lodi (r. 1517–26) the Delhi Sultanate came to an end. 
It gave way to a kingdom that would be among the grandest the world 
had seen: the Mughal Empire.

THE MUGHAL PERIOD 

(1526–1748)

The Mughal Empire marked a high point in the history of the sub-
continent. While its hold over present-day Pakistan wavered, the 

empire’s military campaigns, governance, trade policies, and cultural 
achievements had a large impact on the region. Mughal rule rose from 
the decay of the Delhi Sultanate, a power that never fully recovered 
from its destruction by Timur in the late 14th century. Yet, paradoxi-
cally, it was one of Timur’s great-grandsons, Babur (1483–1530), who 
led the Mughals’ ascension. Today he is celebrated as the first of the 
Six Great Mughals: Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and 
Aurangzeb. The empire grew under an enlightened administrative sys-
tem, mansabdari, that included policies of advancement based on abil-
ity rather than birth, and religious tolerance for expressions of Hindu 
devotion and Shi’i ritual. It became one of the largest centralized states 
in premodern history. The empire’s golden age lasted into the 18th 
century. But poor governance, military setbacks, religious intolerance, 
and European incursions ultimately brought down the empire by the 
middle of that century. Mughals would occupy the kingdom’s throne for 
another century, but by then it had neither the size, the power, nor the 
glory of its former years.

Rise of the Mughals
By the early 16th century what remained of the declining Delhi 
Sultanate faced threats from traditional enemies—tribal kingdoms, 
regional dynasties, and Central Asian invaders—and a new foe: the 
Europeans. These last outsiders came by sea, seeking a direct trade 
route to Southeast Asia bypassing the hazardous overland Silk Route. 
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who pioneered the route around 
Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, was the first; he landed near Calicut

(present-day Kozhikode), on the southwest coast of the subcontinent, 
in 1498. In 1503 he established the first Portuguese “factory,” as the 
trading posts were called, at Cochin, on the southwestern tip of India. 
In 1510 the Portuguese took possession of Goa, farther up the coast, 
and soon established a factory at Diu, in Sind.

THE MUGHAL PERIOD

At the time, what is today’s Pakistan was a patchwork of independent 
Muslim and Hindu fiefdoms. Many leaders of these small states aspired 
to regional dominance. Babur of Ferghana was among them. Babur 
founded the Mughal Empire, and his son, Humayun, spent years rees-
tablishing its rule after rebellions splintered the kingdom in the wake of 
Babur’s death. These two monarchs set the foundation upon which the 
crowning achievements of the Mughal Empire were later built.

Babur
Zahir-ud-Din Muhammad—Babur of Ferghana—was a great-grandson 
of Timur, the Mongol conqueror. Babur’s father was the Timurid king of 
Ferghana, a Turk-dominated region in present-day eastern Uzbekistan. 
Though raised in a Turkic culture, Babur was a Mongol. It was this once 
nomadic group that would give name to a state renowned for its wealth, 
military prowess, artistic achievement, and enlightened government: the 
Mughal Empire. Babur inherited the throne of Ferghana at age 12 upon 
his father’s death. He also inherited his father’s dream of reconquering 
Timur’s empire and ruling from Samarkand, the capital of Ferghana. But 
enemies, including his own relatives and the Uzbek Turks, deposed and 
exiled 14-year-old Babur from Samarkand in 1497.

Over the next few years Babur retook and lost Samarkand twice 
while building an army, and in 1504 he captured Kabul and Ghazni. 
After he realized how little income the poor area could generate, in 
1505 he proceeded through the Khyber Pass to attack what is now 
Pakistan, returning with nothing more than some livestock.

In 1507 Babur set out from Kabul to battle the Khalji tribesmen of 
southeast Afghanistan, going as far south as Kalat in central Baluchistan. 
Now in control of the trade routes, like his forebears he switched from 
plundering caravans to taxing them.

The Timurid’s greatest adversaries were the Uzbek khans, and the 
khan in Babur’s time was Muhammad Shaybani (r. 1500–10). Shaybani 
had driven the Timurids from several of their strongholds, including 
Babur from Samarkand. Babur enlisted as an ally the ruler of Persia, 
Shah Ismael (ca. 1485–1524), founder of the Shi’i Safavid dynasty, 
and their forces defeated Shaybani’s at the Battle of Merv in 1510, kill-
ing the Uzbek khan as he tried to escape. Babur led the allied forces 
to take Samarkand once more the following year. But Babur, a Shia, 
did not enjoy the support of the Sunni populace, and, after renewed 
attacks by the Uzbeks, he abandoned Samarkand again in 1514. For 
the next five years Babur confined his campaigns to Afghanistan and

Babur, founder of the Mughal dynasty, conquered and lost Samarkand twice in his bid to 
gain his father’s throne. In this leaf from Baburnama, produced in the late 16th century, he

THE MUGHAL PERIOD

Baluchistan, but these forays had repercussions in other parts of what 
is now Pakistan, as well.

Reoccupying Kandahar and Kalat, Babur drove the Mongol ruler of 
the area, Shah Beg Arghun (r. 1507–22), into Sind, where Jam Firoz, son 
of the great Samma ruler Jam Nizamuddin (d. 1509), held the throne. 
Shah Beg defeated the Samma forces, and Jam Firoz retreated to Thatta. 
Shah Beg built an island fortress at Bhakkar in the Indus River, between 
present-day Sukkur and Rohri. From here he continued his conquests 
in Sind. In 1520–21 Shah Beg conquered the Samma capital of Thatta, 
and Jam Firoz fled to Gujarat, a city in northwestern Punjab and capital 
of the Gujarat Sultanate, centered in what is today the Indian state of 
Gujarat. The Arghuns’ control of Sind lasted until 1555 and restored the 
region’s cultural ties to Persia.

Conquest of the Punjab and Delhi
In 1519 Babur acquired muskets and artillery and set off for the sub-
continent. He first captured the Yusufzai Fort at Bajaur, in what is today 
the North-West Frontier Province, but failed to conquer the Yusufzai, 
one of the most powerful Pashtun tribes. Most of northwest Pakistan 
was under the control of the Gakkars at the time, and Babur next staged 
a surprise attack on their bastion, Pharwala Fort, near Rawalpindi in 
Punjab. The Gakkar chief surrendered, and in return Babur recognized 
their rule of the Potwar Plateau. Thereafter the Mughals could count 
on Gakkar support for their rule. Returning to his goal to pacify the 
frontier tribes, Babur married the daughter of the Yusufzaisi’s chief, but 
the tribemen remained rebellious. Changing tactics, Babur mounted 
a military campaign in the Hashtnagar region of NWFP. Campaigns 
against tribes along the tributaries of the Indus in Punjab followed, 
including an effort to eradicate Afghan nobles, many of whom had 
settled in Punjab during Lodi rule. Punjabis, whom the Afghans had 
taxed, welcomed their elimination.

Babur’s leadership and military prowess drew the attention of nobles 
seeking a regime change in Delhi. Lodi family members requested 
Babur’s aid in overthrowing Ibrahim I Lodi (r. 1517–26), the sultan of 
Delhi, in part due to his policy of replacing respected military com-
manders with young loyalists. Timur’s lands had included Delhi, and 
as his direct descendant Babur considered the sultanate his birthright. 
Allying himself with various Lodi leaders, Babur assembled an army 
and in 1525 marched toward Delhi. Ibrahim Lodi advanced with an 
army of 100,000 soldiers and 100 elephants to intercept him. The 
forces met in 1526 at the First Battle of Panipat, about 30 miles north

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

POLO

A long with many other traditions, the Mughals introduced polo 
to the subcontinent. The game originated in Central Asia 

sometime between the sixth century B.C.E. and the fi rst century 
C.E. Its name is believed to be derived from the word pulu or phulo, 
meaning “ball” or “ballgame,” respectively, in the Balti language of 
Baltistan, in what is today Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In polo 
two teams mounted on horseback try to drive a small ball through 
the opponent’s goal using long-handled mallets. It is often compared 
to the traditional Afghani sport buzkashi (goat grabbing), in which 
two teams of equestrians attempt to grab the carcass of a headless 
goat and throw it into a scoring circle.

Now often called the sport of kings, polo became the sport of 
Persian nobility, and teams might have as many as 100 horsemen. It 
was also used as a training game for cavalry, as the expert horse-
manship required was highly adaptable to the battlefi eld. Babur is 
credited with establishing the game in the subcontinent. But by 
the 19th century polo had largely been forgotten, relegated to a 
few mountainous pockets in the northern subcontinent. English 
tea planters and military personnel in Manipur, Bengal, rediscov-
ered it in the 1850s. The British developed today’s rules (which 
include having four players per team and dividing the contest into 

of Delhi. Lodi had superior numbers, but Babur’s forces were better 
equipped and more disciplined. On the first day of battle Ibrahim Lodi 
and 15,000 men were killed. Babur was proclaimed emperor of Delhi 
the next day.

Babar’s great-grandfather Timur had conquered Delhi and returned 
to Samarkand. Babur planned to rule from the subcontinent. He recog-
nized that it had resources that made it an advantageous seat of power: 
an abundance of cultivatable lands, plentiful gold and silver, and large 
numbers of skilled workers in every profession and craft.

Babur’s plan to rule from Delhi provoked Rana Sanga of Mewar 
(r. 1509–27), northern India’s strongest ruler and head of the Rajput 
Confederacy, to raise an army of some 210,000 soldiers to oppose 
Babur. In 1527, at the Battle at Khanua, near Agra, Babur defeated the 
numerically superior Rajputs, becoming the master of the northern 
subcontinent. He granted rule of Rajput territories to his followers,

subcontinent. From there it spread to England, South America, 
and beyond.

who included Rajput and Afgan nobles and Gakkar chiefs. Among his 
first acts was to construct a road from Kabul to Agra, passing through 
Lahore to ease travel in the territory.

Throughout this time Multan had retained its independence. But 
in 1526, following a 15-month siege, the Arghun rulers of Sind con-
quered the city, sacked it, and massacred the survivors. The remaining 
inhabitants united behind the former commander of the Multan army 
and expelled the Arghun governor, then pledged their loyalty to the 
governor of Punjab, a suzerain of Babur’s.

Meanwhile, allies of the former Delhi sultan, Ibrahim Lodi, tried to 
regain their kingdom. Under the leadership of his brother, Mahmud, 
during his brief reign as king of Bihar (r. 1528–29), Afghan chiefs of 
Bihar and Bengal, raised an army to fight Babur. The opposing forces 
met at the river Ghaghara in 1529 in Babur’s last major battle. He 
emerged victorious, ending the last regional threat to his power.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Humayun
Babur died in 1530 at age 47. He left his Indian territories to Humayun 
(1508–56), his eldest son, and the Kabul kingdom to his youngest son, 
Kamran (1509–57). But Babur’s hold over the northern regions was 
weak, and with him gone, restive rulers asserted their independence, 
among them Bahadur Shah (r. 1526–35, 1536–37), the Afghan ruler of 
Gujarat; Rajput chiefs; and Sher Khan (1486–1545). The son of a minor 
Afghan ruler, Sher Khan, who had briefly served in Babur’s forces, 
assumed control of Bihar by the early 1530s.

Determined to regain control of his inherited kingdom, Humayun 
(r. 1530–40, 1555–56) fought Bahadur Shah and the rebellious Rajputs 
in a series of skirmishes. He defeated Bahadur Shah in 1535. But Sher 
Khan led a campaign into Bengal and defeated Humayun’s forces at 
Chausa on the banks of the Ganges in 1539. Taking control of Delhi, 
he proclaimed himself Sher Shah Sur. At a subsequent encounter at 
Kanauj in 1540, Humayun’s troops fled before the battle even began. 
Humayun escaped to Lahore and sought protection from his brother, 
Kamran. With Sher Shah Sur in pursuit, both brothers left Lahore but 
split up after a dispute at the Jhelum River at Khushab. Kamran went 
to Kabul, and Humayun went south and joined his mother and brother 
Hindal in Sind. Here he met his future wife, Hamida Bano. Seeking 
either an alliance with the Rajput chiefs or their conquest, he and his 
new wife and followers set out across the Thar Desert to Rajasthan, 
where they received protection from the rajas of Umarkot (today’s 
Tharparker District in Sind), whose territory included parts of what is 
today Rajasthan state in India. His son Jalal-ud-Din Akbar was born at 
Umarkot Fort in 1542.

Seeking more secure refuge in his brother Kamran’s domain in 
Afghanistan, Humayun led his group to Kandahar but came under 
attack there as well and once again fled, finally finding sanctuary in 
Persia. Akbar, his son, was left with an aunt in the Kabul kingdom ter-
ritories.

Sher Shah Sur
Having chased Humayun to Punjab, Sher Shah Sur (r. 1540–45) de-
manded obeisance from the Gakkar rulers, and when they refused he 
awarded their land to thousands of Afghan tribesmen who had recently 
settled in the area and to three Baluchi chiefs: Ismael Khan, Fateh Khan, 
and Ghazi Khan. The Gakkars gathered an army to fight Sher Shah, but 
were defeated at the Fort of Rewat in Rawalpindi.

THE MUGHAL PERIOD

from Mughal and Gakkar invaders. (Courtesy Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation)

During his brief, five-year reign Sher Shah’s empire stretched from 
the Indus Valley through Bengal, and from Kashmir in the north to 
Chanderi and Benares in central India. He was more concerned about 
outside invaders than regional rebellions and considered the Mughals 
a greater threat than Chinggis Khan or Timur had been in their time. 
Balban and Ala-ud-Din Khalji had established the Delhi Sultanate as 
a bulwark against Mongol invaders. Sher Shah in turn developed his 
kingdom to defend the region against the Mughals. He built a massive 
fort at Rohtas (current-day Rohtak, in the Indian state of Haryana), 
some three miles around, to defend his kingdom’s western borders from 
the Mughals and Gakkars.

However, his successes as a ruler outshined his military victories. 
He introduced many reforms embraced by the Mughal rulers and the 
British colonial overseers who succeeded them. He effectively reorga-
nized the state’s administrative system, built a network of roads (one of 
the them, the Grand Trunk Road, extending from the Indus to eastern 
Bengal, is still in use today), stimulated commerce by overhauling the 
customs system, and promoted religious tolerance. He also established 
a professional, salaried army and introduced a system of coins, the

rupayya, whose name is still used for coinage in Pakistan, India, and 
neighboring countries to this day.

Sher Shah was killed in 1545 in an explosion while storming the 
Rajput hill fortress at Kalinjar in present-day Uttar Pradesh state in 
central India. On his deathbed he declared his sorrow that he had not 
destroyed Lahore, eliminating this tempting target of conquerors who 
used its spoils to continue to fuel their invasions. Some consider Sher 
Shah the last of the Delhi sultans, and perhaps the greatest.

After Sher Shah’s death, his younger son, Jalal Khan, took control as 
Islam Shah (r. 1545–53) and ruled until his death in 1553. Four more 
descendants of Sher Shah ruled the dynasty until the last among them, 
Sikander Shah Sur (r. 1555), was defeated in battle by Humayun.

It was during the final years of the Sur dynasty that Europeans first 
took military action in the area that is now Pakistan. In 1554 the last 
of the Arghun, the family that ruled Sind, died. Two Turkish chiefs 
divided Sind between them, making Thatta and Bhakkar (near pres-
ent-day Rohri on the Indus) their capitals. Thatta, a port strategically 
located at the apex of the Indus delta, had served as the capital of lower 
Sind since the 14th century. By this time the Portuguese had estab-
lished trading posts along the west coast of the subcontinent. One of 
the new Turkish chiefs sought an alliance with the Portuguese against 
the other, and the Portuguese agreed to come to his assistance. But by 
the time the Portuguese sailed into the Indus and anchored, the two 
chiefs had made peace. Angered that the alliance had been called off, 
the Portuguese sacked and burned Thatta and the surrounding coun-
tryside, slaughtering many.

Humayun’s Return
Humayun, now in Persia, persuaded the shah of Persia to back him, as 
Humayun’s father Babur had done with the shah’s predecessor. With the 
shah’s support, Humayun attacked and took Kandahar and Kabul from 
his brother, Kamran. Akbar, Humayun’s son, was in his uncle’s custody 
at the time of the attack, and Kamran exposed Akbar at the walls of 
Kabul Fort during the assault, trying to induce his father to stop the 
bombardment. Nonetheless Humayun took Kabul and appointed nine-
year-old Akbar governor of Kabul. With the city secured, Humayun set 
off for the subcontinent with Akbar, still eager to reclaim his inherited 
empire from the ashes of Sher Sur’s kingdom. They arrived in 1554.

Kamran had tried to ally himself with Sher Sur’s successors but 
was arrested by the Gakkars and held for Humayun’s disposal. On 
Humayun’s orders he was blinded and sent on a pilgrimage to Mecca

to contemplate his sins. Humayun conquered Rohtas Fort without a 
fight, as the Afghan governor and garrison had fled. Humayun captured 
Lahore, then Sirhind, where he defeated Sikander Sur before claiming 
Delhi and Agra in 1555.

Inspired by the Safavid art he had encountered while in exile in 
Persia, Humayun recruited court artists who developed the celebrated 
Mughal school of painting. He also oversaw the construction of grand 
edifices that helped define the Mughal style of architecture. But his 
enjoyment of the regained throne was brief. Humayun died in 1556 
after falling down stairs in his library. His tomb in Delhi is one of the 
finest examples of Mughal architecture in the subcontinent. Some of 
the details of his life come from memoirs of his sister, daughter of 
Babur, Gulbadan Begum.

With the Mughal Empire’s borders secure, its army powerful, and 
the framework for its administration in place, the next three emper-
ors—Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan—would engineer and preside 
over the empire’s greatest achievements. But during the reign of the last 
of the Great Mughals, Aurangzeb, the empire’s power would begin to 
decline, never to recover.

Akbar
Akbar the Great (r. 1556–1605) was 13 at the time of his father’s death in 
1556. His guardian, Bairam Khan, proclaimed him emperor of Hindustan, 
a term used historically to refer to the Indian subcontinent.

Sher Shah Sur’s two nephews, Sikander and Adil, could not over-
come their mutual animosity to join forces against Akbar. Adil’s army 
was led by Hemu, a Hindu minister and general. Hemu conquered 
Agra in October of 1556 and conquered Delhi immediately after 
when the Mughal general Tardi Beg fled. Hemu took the title of Raja 
Vikramaditya, literally “sun of valor,” borrowing the name of a legend-
ary Hindu king. The day after Akbar learned Delhi had fallen, news 
came that Kabul was in revolt. Against the counsel of all his advisers 
except his guardian, rather than returning to Kabul to put down the 
uprising, Akbar marched on Delhi and decisively defeated Hemu’s army 
at the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556.

Akbar’s Early Years
In 1560 Akbar took full control of the kingdom from his guardian, 
whom he sent on a pilgrimage to Mecca to eliminate any possibility of 
meddling. During the years 1561–76, Akbar reconquered Malwa and

THE MUGHAL PERIOD

Gondwana (in the present-day Indian state of Maharashtra), the Rajput 
kingdoms, Gujarat, Bihar, and Bengal. This marked the end of the first 
phase of his campaigns of conquest.

Akbar instituted reforms and treated with respect Rajput rulers who 
submitted to him, allowing them to retain their power. He used inter-
marriage between members of the ruling family and Rajput princesses to 
cement relationships. He gathered detailed records on agricultural produc-
tion and prices in an effort to regulate the economy. For assessing taxes 
and collecting revenue he adopted the system developed for Sher Shah 
Sur by Todar Mal, a Rajput king (r. 1560–86). Revenue went mostly to 
pay military officers, who were responsible for providing for their soldiers 
and members of the court. Officers, or mansabdars, as these overseers 
were known, were rotated every three years from territories to keep them 
from becoming feudal lords. Previously the Arabic term iqta was used for 
these territorial assignments. By Akbar’s reign it had been replaced by the 
Persian term jagir, as the system would henceforth be known.

The assignment of lands to administer was prone to corruption, as 
those who made the assignments expected bribes to grant a jagir where 
productivity was high and the population was not restive. The demand 
for kickbacks created discontent among military officers. In 1574 
Akbar ended the assignment system in the provinces with the oldest 
links to the empire, including Lahore, Multan, Delhi, and Agra. These 
areas were managed as khalsa (state-controlled land) for the next five 
years. Officers in charge got cash salaries rather than a percentage of 
revenues. But the plan failed, as officers had no incentive to stimulate 
productivity, and land fell out of cultivation in these areas. Meanwhile, 
local rulers oppressed and taxed the peasants, leading to depopulation. 
In response Akbar changed the tax system. Through detailed studies of 
soil quality, water availability, and other factors for individual parcels, 
along with local market conditions, assessments were based on what 
the land was capable of producing. This spurred investment in the land 
and renewed efforts to improve its productivity.

State and Religion
Tolerant of other religions, in 1563 Akbar removed the tax imposed 
on those who visited Hindu shrines and in 1564 eliminated the jizya, 
the tax on non-Muslims. He attempted to have local rulers emulate his

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

THE MANSABDARI AND 
JAGIRDARI SYSTEMS

Akbar instituted the civil service system upon which the Mughal 
Empire’s administration was based. The system had its roots 

in the Delhi Sultanate, when rulers such as Ala-ud-Din Khalji and 
Muhammad ibn Tughluq created a prototypical revenue and payroll 
plan. Sher Shah Sur reorganized it, and Akbar refi ned it.

Government offi cers were organized in 33 levels or grades. Each 
government offi cer held the honorifi c mansabdar (because he had 
rank) or mansab, if he had suffi cient rank. Royal family members typi-
cally had exclusive rights to the very top ranks. Those with the rank 
of Commander of the Five Hundred and above held the title of emir, 
or “noble.” Most offi cers initially received cash allowances generated 
from the khalsa, or state-controlled lands, dispensed by the royal 
treasury. Akbar believed cash payments encouraged loyalty, but the 
government found it increasingly diffi cult to manage enough khalsa 
lands to raise the revenue.

Over time a growing number of offi cers received jagirs, assigned 
lands they administered and from which was generated income to 
pay their salaries and that of their troops as well as to meet other 
expenses. Akbar and later rulers were eager to prevent offi cers 
from creating fi efdoms. Thus the positions were not hereditary, and 
jagirdaris (those who administered the jagirs) were rotated to new 
assignments every few years. The system helped stabilize the empire 
by maintaining government control of property. But it also led to 
exploitation of the lands since the jagirdaris cared only to maximize 
income during their tenure. Their oppression led farmers, and later 
merchants and artisans, to fl ee jagirs for lands controlled by rajas 
and zamindars (lords of the land). These local rulers retained their 
hereditary positions from pre-Mughal times and were allowed to 
keep their power as long as they remained loyal and provided troops 
and tribute to the empire. Over time these independent tribal chiefs 
and kingdoms came to present a major threat to the Mughals as their 
power declined.

nondiscriminatory practices. Though a Muslim himself, after listen-
ing to ongoing disagreements of the ulama, or Muslim religious lead-
ers, Akbar became disenchanted with Islamic orthodoxy, and created 
the Hall of Worship, where religious thinkers could come to discuss

their religions. He invited Zoroastrians, Christians, Jews, Hindus, and 
Jains to explain the tenets of their faith. In 1579 he promulgated his 
Infallibility Decree, which mandated that any conflict among the ulama 
would be decided by the emperor.

In 1580 nobles and religious leaders in Bihar and Bengal revolted, 
upset at Akbar’s religious unorthodoxy and reduction of their allow-
ances. Akbar’s half-brother, Mirza Hakim (d. 1585), ruler of Kabul, 
seized the opportunity and marched on Punjab, but was unsuccess-
ful in his effort to capture the Rohtas fort or Lahore. He retreated to 
avoid Akbar’s advancing army, which had arrived at the Sutlej River. 
Akbar dispatched the great Hindu general Man Singh (1540–1614) to 
chase Mirza Hakim, while Akbar headed for Kabul, which he occupied, 
installing his sister, Bakhtunissa Begum, as governor.

By 1582 Akbar had proclaimed himself God’s representative on earth 
and the leader of a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, the Divine Faith, which 
combined elements of Islam and Hinduism. He created new rites and 
ceremonies, some of which offended Muslims. His flirtation with 
unorthodox theosophies ended by 1590, when he was again practicing 
Islam. But his tolerance created a long-standing backlash in the Muslim 
community, which demanded that future emperors be unwavering in 
their Islamic faith. Leaders would find the most convincing way to 
demonstrate their orthodoxy was by practicing intolerance toward 
other religions as well as any unorthodox form of Islam. Thus Akbar’s 
efforts to encourage tolerance and diversity drove the sociopolitical 
climate in the opposite direction.

Akbar’s Middle Years
It was in this period that Akbar built Attock Fort at the point he crossed 
the Indus, usurping the town of Ohind’s position as a major crossing 
point of the river as well as the Rohtas fort’s importance as a frontier 
bastion.

Punjab and Upper Sind, whose fortunes had declined during the years 
the jagir system was modified, were now rebounding. Multan retained 
its importance as a religious center and trade capital, while Sehwan held 
its position as a commercial hub bustling with trade and industry.

During the years 1584–98, Akbar ruled from Lahore, which remained 
a center of commerce as well as government. Abdul Fazal (d. 1602), 
Akbar’s friend and court historian, claimed the city had a thousand 
shops that made sheets and shawls alone. Akbar built a new mint to 
produce coinage for the realm and constructed a red brick wall around 
the old city. Some of its original 12 gates still stand.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Akbar’s campaigns to subjugate the frontier in Kashmir, Lower Sind, 
Baluchistan, and parts of the Deccan continued during these years. 
Much of the agricultural land in Punjab at this time was under direct 
state control. Jagirdars, as those who oversaw the jagirs were known, 
were more closely monitored here than those at the fringes of empire.

Akbar was eager to secure the Kabul area for the Mughal Empire. 
Mirza Hakim had been ruling Kabul under his sister’s nominal gover-
norship. When he died in 1585, Akbar set out to conquer it, in part 
to keep it from falling to the Uzbek Turks, who likewise coveted the 
territory. Akbar, encamped at Attock, sent Man Singh to take over 
Kabul. Boatmen were brought from the east to ferry forces across 
the Indus. But Akbar was unable to subdue the border area, primar-
ily due to resistance of the Afridi tribe. The Afridi and others in the 
area were adherents of the Roshanaya movement, a Sufi offshoot, 
so called for the adopted name of its founder Bayazid Ansari (ca. 
1525–82/85), who called himself Pir-i-Roshan (the enlightened one 
or pir of [Mount] Roshan). Ansari’s son Jalala refused to recognize 
Mughal rule and to permit Akbar’s passage through the area. Akbar 
finally forced Jalala to flee to Chitral, a town in today’s NWFP, where 
he died in 1601. But his absence and death did not dampen restive-
ness in the frontier area.

Akbar also attempted to expand the empire northward, but his 
campaigns in 1585 to conquer the Yusufzais and Kashmir, mounted 
to take advantage of internecine fighting among Muslim sects there, 
were unsuccessful. Though the attack failed, a resulting treaty gave 
the Mughals the right to buy Kashmir’s saffron crop. In 1586 Akbar 
finally conquered Kashmir, making the Mughals the sole purveyor in 
the saffron market. Profits were vast. But high tax rates imposed on the 
peasant farmers caused a rebellion in Kashmir, and the tax rates were 
rolled back.

Akbar’s Later Years
Following the Portuguese destruction of Thatta, the city was rebuilt. 
But renewed civil war among Turkish chiefs of Sind broke out. Sensing 
an opening, Akbar, back in Lahore from Attock, ordered the governor of 
Multan to attack lower Sind, and by 1592 the region had been annexed 
by the Mughal Empire. Baluchistan and Makran were annexed in 1594. 
The following year the shah of Persia, who had seized Kandahar after 
helping Humayun regain his empire, gave it to Akbar. All of the north-
ern subcontinent was now under his rule, and thus in 1595 Akbar

THE MUGHAL PERIOD

commenced the third and final phase of his campaigns of conquest: 
marching his forces southward to the Deccan. By 1601 almost all of the 
subcontinent was Mughal territory.

Under Akbar security was enhanced throughout the empire, lead-
ing to increased trade. Commerce was also stimulated by the currency 
system and mints he founded. A private banking system with letters of 
credit evolved. Goods from Kashmir and Kabul were shipped through 
Multan to Thatta’s principal port of Larri Bunder. European appetite 
for dye brought Portuguese and Dutch traders to the region, and the 
manufacture of indigo dye became a major industry, enriching the 
kingdom.

Akbar’s contributions to the arts are likewise remembered. Though 
he could neither read nor write, he collected literature and art from 
around the world and commissioned buildings and monuments. These 
edifices range from the tomb of his father, Humayun, in Delhi, consid-
ered the first great Mughal monument, to the entire city of Fatehpur 
Sikri (City of Victory), which served as his capital from 1569 to 1584. 
For his legacy of accomplishments in war and peace, Akbar is consid-
ered the greatest Mughal ruler.

Jahangir
Akbar’s sole surviving son, Salim, had rebelled against him and tried to 
set up a kingdom of his own in the Deccan. Akbar nonetheless anointed 
him as his successor, and Salim ascended to the throne upon Akbar’s 
death in October 1605. He took the title Jahangir (r. 1605–27). Jahangir 
had spent his formative years around Lahore, his father’s capital for 
much of his reign. His companion as a youngster at home in nearby 
Sheikhupura was Abdullah Bhatti, the son of a tribal chief whom Akbar 
had executed. Akbar also killed, in a fit of rage, a woman in his harem, 
Anarkali, whom Jahangir had fallen in love with. Her tomb is in her 
eponymous bazaar in Lahore.

Soon after Jahangir’s ascension his eldest son, Prince Khusrow, tried 
wresting control of the empire by laying siege to Lahore. Somewhat 
paradoxically, Khusrow’s attempted coup was supported by nobles 
angered by the disloyalty Jahangir had shown to his father in trying 
to establish an independent state in the Deccan. Jahangir came from 
Agra to battle his son, and their armies met at the Chenab River, with 
Jahangir’s forces prevailing. Prince Khusrow was captured trying to flee 
the area. As punishment he was blinded and incarcerated, and 700 of 
his followers were impaled in Lahore.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

The leader of the Sikhs, Guru Arjan Dev (1563–1606), was sus-
pected of aiding the prince, and his lands were confiscated; he and his 
sons were imprisoned. Up to that point the Sikhs had been apolitical. 
Jahangir had Arjan executed in prison, but, after his release, his son 
Guru Hargobind (1595–1644) formed a Sikh self-defense force, which 
became a longstanding opponent of the Mughal dynasty.

Meanwhile Abdullah Bhatti, Jahangir’s childhood friend, led a force 
against him to avenge his father’s death. Jahangir tried negotiating a 
settlement, but when that failed, he reluctantly suppressed the uprising. 
Meanwhile, resistance by the Roshanaya movement, which had begun 
under his father’s reign, continued, and Jalala’s successors attacked 
Peshawar in 1613. The town of Shikarpur in upper Sind became a cen-
ter of resistance to the Mughals.

Jahangir’s reign was a time of peace and prosperity within his king-
dom. The Mughal style of painting reached its zenith under him. But 
agricultural production began to decline during his reign because of the 
growing corruption within the jagir system. Jahangir’s rule was assisted 
by his ambitious and beautiful wife, a Persian princess he dubbed Nur 
Jehan (Light of the World). She had a large hand in administering and 
ruling the kingdom, as did her family members, including her father, 
a Persian, and her brother Asaf Khan. Jahangir’s third son, Prince 
Khurram, also part of Nur Jehan’s inner circle, married Asaf Khan’s 
daughter, Mumtaz Mahal. In 1615 Prince Khurram conquered the last 
Rajput fortresses in Mewar. However, the state of Ahmadnagar resisted 
conquest, and during the campaign Ahmadnagar Fort, which had been 
captured during Akbar’s rule, was retaken from the Mughals. Prince 
Khurram succeeded in regaining the fort and was given the title Shah 
Jahan, Lord of the World.

Jahangir’s fondness for alcohol was now affecting his health. Nur 
Jehan wanted her youngest son, Prince Shahriyar, to succeed Jahangir, 
as he would be the easiest for her to control. Signaling her intent, 
she gave the hand of her daughter, conceived in an earlier marriage, 
to Shahriyar. Shah Jahan, who was the popular choice to take over 
Jahangir’s throne, revolted in 1622. But his army was defeated in 1625 
by Mahabat Khan, Nur Jehan’s general. Nur Jehan, now worried about 
Mahabat’s growing power, accused him of corruption. In response, 
Mahabat staged an insurrection and captured Jahangir in 1626 while 
he was en route to Kashmir. Nur rescued Jahangir, but the ruler died 
in 1627. Asaf Khan, Nur’s brother, arrested her, and Shah Jahan was 
named emperor. Shahriyar was blinded and imprisoned, and Nur gave 
up statecraft, spending her time overseeing construction of her tomb.

THE MUGHAL PERIOD

European Trade
During the Mughal era European powers established footholds in the 
subcontinent. A century after the Portuguese had successfully estab-
lished trading posts along the west coast of India and Pakistan, the 
English, French, and Dutch, hearing of vast profits, followed suit. In 
1600, a group of London merchants formed the East India Company 
(EIC) to trade with India under a charter from Queen Elizabeth I 
(1533–1603).

In 1615 an ambassador from England, Sir Thomas Roe (1581–1644), 
arrived at Jahangir’s court. He was the second such emissary. Seven 
years earlier England’s king James I (1566–1625) had sent Turki-
speaking Captain William Hawkins with a request to Jahangir for a 
trade concession at Surat on the Gujarat coast. Though Hawkins was 
received graciously and remained for two years, the Portuguese held 
sway, and permission was denied. Roe had better luck. After three years 
in residence he won concessions for the EIC as well as permission to 
build a factory in Surat. Jahangir’s largesse to the English angered the 
Portuguese, who attacked Mughal shipping in retaliation. Jahangir in 
turn arrested all Portuguese in the empire, closed their churches, and 
declared war. The Portuguese sued for peace. The English built Surat 
into a thriving trade center and sought additional outposts in other 
parts of India.

The Dutch and French formed East India companies of their own, 
in 1602 and 1664, respectively. Most of the outposts were on the east 
coast of the subcontinent, putting them closer to the East Indies (pres-
ent-day Indonesia) spice trade. Bengal and Bihar became economic 
centers. The Portuguese and the Dutch went on to fight for control of 
the East Indies, a war the Dutch would win. The British and French 
battled over the subcontinent, with the British finally prevailing in the 
mid-18th century.

Shah Jahan
Shah Jahan (r. 1627–57) pursued a westward expansionist policy, relo-
cating his court to Kabul for two years in pursuit of this goal. During the 
height of Shah Jahan’s reign, the Mughal Empire was the most advanced 
in the world, the leading light in commerce, culture, and architecture, 
wealthy beyond the ability to catalog its riches. Among the architectural 
works created during his reign was the Taj Mahal, the tomb of Jahan’s 
beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. But Shah Jahan’s reign also marked the 
beginning of the empire’s decline, signaled by rebellions in lower Sind,

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

the collapse of Mughal rule in the Deccan, and a stagnating economy. 
After crippling the agricultural sector by overtaxing farmers, the 
Mughals began raising taxes on urban enterprises, traders, and artisans. 
The government entered into trading agreements with European compa-
nies to raise revenue. With wealth becoming concentrated and revenues 
falling, the nobility sought wars as a way of expanding Mughal territory 
and gaining more revenue, but wars proved increasingly expensive and 
unsuccessful. Still, the royal court continued in its lavish ways.

One region in which warfare did prove successful was the Deccan, 
which had slipped from the empire’s grasp since Akbar’s conquests of 
1595–1601. Three of the five Deccan Sultanates—Ahmadnagar, Berar, 
and Bidar—were reabsorbed into the Mughal Empire. The other two, 
Golkonda and Bijapur, became tribute-paying states.

Aurangzeb
In 1657, with Shah Jahan suffering a serious illness, a battle for suc-
cession erupted among his four sons—Aurangzeb, Shah Shuja, Murad 
Bakhsh, and Dara Shukoh—from which Aurangzeb emerged victori-
ous. He took over Agra and imprisoned his father in Agra Fort until 
his death in 1666 at age 74. He then pursued his three brothers. Murad 
was arrested and in 1661 executed. Shah Shuja fled into the jungles 
of Burma. Dara Shukoh, the eldest, raised an army to fight Aurangzeb 
but was deserted by erstwhile allies, and in 1569 was captured and 
executed for heresy by Aurangzeb’s forces.

Aurangzeb (1618–1707) was the last of the great Mughals. Under 
his rule (r. 1658–1707) the Mughal armies led almost constant wars of 
conquest, and the empire expanded to its largest size. In 1661 the east-
ern kingdom of Cooch was annexed by the Mughals. Portuguese pirates 
were driven from the area after the Mughals conquered the Bengal port 
of Chittagong in 1666. But the warfare almost bankrupted the empire, 
and the empire’s hold on the new territories was weak. An unpopu-
lar ruler, Aurangzeb faced rebellions by the Yusufzais near Peshawar 
(1667, 1672–76); the Sikhs in Anandpur, in what is today the Indian 
state of Punjab (beginning in 1668 and lasting for several years); and 
the Marathas, beginning in 1670. Shivaji Bhonsle (1630–80), the leader 
of the Maratha Hindu kingdom, had risen to take over Deccan territory. 
By 1663 Shivaji controlled Bijapur territory in the Deccan and Mughal 
territory in Ahmadnagar. The Mughals’ inability to deal effectively 
with Shivaji was emblematic of their declining fortunes. Aurangzeb

dispatched his uncle, Shaista Khan, to attack Shivaji. The Mughals won 
the initial engagement, but Shivaji counterattacked and expelled the 
Mughal forces from the region. Aurangzeb then ordered one of his most 
powerful generals, the Rajput Jai Singh, to carry on the fight against the 
Marathas, and the campaign was a success. Shivaji accepted the terms 
of surrender and was placed under house arrest at the royal court in 
Agra. But Shivaji escaped and regained power in his old territory. He 
recaptured forts and expanded his dominion to the south, forming a 
strong independent state.

Meanwhile, Aurangzeb adopted religious policies that created schisms 
within the empire, further weakening it. A devout Sunni Muslim, he 
ended the practice of religious tolerance and tried to force the conver-
sion of Hindus to Islam. He changed the legal system, making sharia, 
Islamic law, the law of the land. With the exception of construction of 
the Badshahi Mosque he also turned his back on the promotion of great 
works of art and architecture that had characterized Mughal rule up to 
this time. He banned singers, musicians, and dancers from his court 
and built few grand monuments or buildings.

The English also gained stronger footholds in the subcontinent dur-
ing this period. They received Bombay, which the Portuguese had held, 
as the wedding dowry of Catherine Henrietta of Braganza (1638–1705),

THE MUGHAL PERIOD

a Portuguese princess who married King Charles II (1630–85). By then 
Surat had proved vulnerable, having been sacked twice by Shivaji (in 
1664 and 1670). The English relocated their headquarters to Bombay. 
They cleared its swamps and by 1677 created a more substantial factory.

Sir Joshua Child, the chairman of the EIC at the time, wanted to 
strengthen Britain’s position in the subcontinent. In 1685 12 English 
warships were sent to take establish and control fortifications at 
Chittagong. Mughal forces met and defeated them. In retaliation 
England blockaded several ports on the Indian west coast. They 
seized Mughal ships and kept pilgrims from making the hajj to Mecca. 
Aurangzeb ordered his forces to attack English trading posts. Several 
including Surat were taken by the Mughals. EIC representatives were 
killed. The company appealed to Aurangzeb for an end to the attacks 
and agreed to pay for the seized ships and compensate the Mughal 
ruler for other damages. In return Aurangzeb pardoned the English and 
granted them a new trading license in 1690.

At the time, English pirates were active in the region, but the EIC did 
little to stem their activity. In 1695 English pirates seized a Mughal ship 
carrying pilgrims and trade profits. In response the Mughal governor of 
Surat arrested the local head of the EIC and put the city’s English citi-
zens under custody—in chains—to protect them from angry Muslim 
residents. On India’s east coast, the English were allowed to create a 
trading post on the Hooghly River in Bengal in 1697. This became the 
city of Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), the capital of British India from 
1858 until 1912. Another major British trade center on the east coast 
was Madras (present-day Chennai). The British hired local soldiers 
they called sepoys and formed armed forces for their own protection. 
Over time local rulers asked the British to lend them the sepoy forces 
to help with security. In return for concessions and land, the British 
often agreed; they increasingly became more involved in local affairs 
and took control of more land.

The frontier area in what is now northwest Pakistan was another 
region that tested Mughal domination. The Yusufzai had been in rebel-
lion since the beginning of Aurangzeb’s reign. In 1667 a force of 5,000 
Yusufzai mounted a series of invasions into Pakhli (present-day Hazara 
district). Mughal forces responding to the uprising soundly defeated 
the rebels. A 1672 revolt by the Satnamis of East Punjab, a fanatical 
Hindu sect, was also brutally put down. Meanwhile the Jats (not to be 
confused with the Jats of Afghanistan), an ethnic group in the northern 
subcontinent whose kingdom centered around Agra, continued causing 
havoc as they had since Akbar’s reign.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Affairs of State
Corruption of the administration system became endemic under 
Aurangzeb, driving more peasants from the land, lowering state income, 
and further weakening the empire. Aurangzeb tried to improve the lot of 
peasants, but his orders were often ignored by landowners and admin-
istrators. At the same time his anti-Hindu policies, which included 
restrictions on religious practices and the desecration and destruction 
of temples, further alienated his subjects. This encouraged more anti-
Mughal activity and helped fuel the Marathas’ rebellion. Aurangzeb also 
alienated the Rajputs by trying to put them under greater state control, 
which led to a Rajput uprising. Unhappy with the way his son, Prince 
Akbar, handled the rebellions, Aurangzeb replaced him, and Prince 
Akbar was subsequently recruited by the Rajputs to lead their forces in 
revolt against Aurangzeb. But Aurangzeb tricked the Rajput forces into 
deserting Akbar. However, the war with the Rajputs continued, and 
Aurangzeb had to cede them some degree of autonomy.

Aurangzeb tracked his rebellious son into the Deccan. Prince Akbar 
escaped pursuit, but the empire’s forces remained in the Deccan for 26 
years (1681–1707), and during this time finally captured the Marathas’ 
leader, Shivaji. The Mughal army boasted 170,000 men, but the force 
was unwieldy, and its officers were more interested in pursuing leisure 
at home than engaging in foreign campaigns. Thus the army’s power 
was blunted. Losses mounted in the Deccan. The conflict sapped the 
empire’s strength and will, and it began to suffer setbacks in the north 
as well. The upper classes were dissatisfied because of deteriorating 
economic conditions. In 1690, Aurangzeb tried to placate the nobil-
ity by promising them ownership of lands under their control. But the 
flight of the peasants was making land less productive, and, by 1700 the 
nobles were demanding cash rather than land, and all the local chiefs 
were in revolt.

The Sikhs coexisted with the Mughals at the beginning of Aurangzeb’s 
reign, mostly due to their own internal dissension. But after Aurangzeb 
ordered the execution of the ninth Sikh guru, Tegh Bahadur (1621–75), 
the 10th and last guru, Guru Gobind Singh Gurdwara (1666–1708), 
formed the Khalsa, the movement’s military arm, in 1699. The Khalsa 
were baptized with water stirred with a dagger. Wearing “the five K’s” 
was mandated: kesha, uncut hair, symbolizing spirituality; kaccha, short 
pants, signifying self-control and chastity; kangha, comb, symbolizing 
hygiene and discipline; kara, iron bangle, signifying restraint of action 
and remembrance of God; and kirpan, dagger, a symbol of dignity and 
struggles against injustice. Aurangzeb mounted a campaign of suppres-

sion against them near the end of his reign, and Mughal forces laid siege 
to the Sikhs at Amandpur in 1704. The siege was unsuccessful, and 
the Sikhs were promised safe passage, but the Mughals and their allies 
slaughtered them once they left their fortifications.

Decline of the Mughals
As Mughal power declined, small independent principalities emerged 
in the frontier area, Baluchistan, and Sind. Indeed, the Kabul-Ghazni-
Peshawar area had never been totally under Mughal control. Aurangzeb 
had futilely spent more than a year at Hasan Abdal in the frontier area 
trying to suppress the Yusufzai and other Pashtun tribes.

In 1695 the Ahmedzai clan established a dynasty in Kalat in central 
Baluchistan that ruled the region’s nomads, primarily Baluchis and 
Brahuis. The ruler was known as the khan of Kalat, and the state as 
the Khanate. (The British later called this the Brahui Confederacy.) 
Kalat was strong enough to assert independence from the Persians and 
the sultans of Delhi who had alternately claimed control of the area in 
preceding years. Mughal efforts to conquer the area failed. Ahmedzais 
would remain khans of Kalat until Kalat agreed to join the newly inde-
pendent Pakistan in 1948.

Maritime commerce, which had been an important part of the 
empire’s economy, was also in decline during this period. The harbor at 
Thatta and other Sind ports were filling with silt despite Mughal efforts 
under Aurangzeb and his successor to clear them. And ports in nearby 
Gujarat faced attacks by Marathas, who gained control over western 
coastal waters.

Aurangzeb died in 1707 at the age of 80. After brief infighting 63-
year-old Shah Alam (r. 1707–12), Aurangzeb’s most capable son and the 
former governor of Kabul and Peshawar, took the throne. He assumed 
the title Bahadur Shah but ruled only five years before he died in 
Lahore. Bahadur Shah’s death marked the end of the Mughal Empire’s 
glory. Looting broke out in Lahore as armies of those vying for succes-
sion converged on the city to gain control of the empire.

Of Bahadur’s four sons, Prince Azam was most admired. His three 
brothers were encouraged by a nobleman to challenge him for rule. 
Azam drowned with his elephant, and the nobleman arranged for the 
least capable of the siblings, Jahandur Shah, to take the throne so his 
backers could control the empire. Azam’s son, Farukkhsiyar (1683–
1719) defeated Jahandur with the help of two officers, the Sayyid 
brothers. When Farukkhsiyar took the throne in 1713, it was under the

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

control of the Sayyid brothers. During his reign the Europeans, espe-
cially the British, were able to get favorable treatment for their trading 
ventures by bribing officials. In 1715–16 the Mughals achieved a final 
victory in eastern Punjab over the Sikhs, who were led by Banda Singh 
Bahadur (1670–1716). Banda and thousands of Sikhs were tortured and 
killed. But Sikh unrest continued, destabilizing the kingdom and com-
promising trade, with bands of Sikh robbers raiding the caravans.

In 1719 the Sayyids had Farukkhsiyar incarcerated and killed. The 
Sayyids installed two subsequent puppet regents in the same year before 
Muhammad Shah (r. 1719–48), a 20-year-old grandson of Bahadur 
Shah, was named ruler. The Sayyid brothers’ ruthless machinations 
caused their own deaths, which came within a year of Muhammad’s 
ascension. Muhammad’s rule lasted almost 30 years, marked by contin-
ued loss of territory and power as those around him grabbed what they 
could from the disintegrating empire.

The mid-18th century marked the nadir of Muslim fortunes in the 
subcontinent. One of the leading reformers who attempted to halt the 
decline of Muslim rule and revive its intellectual traditions was Shah 
Waliullah (1703–62). After completing Islamic studies in Mecca in 
1734, he returned to the subcontinent and began preaching, calling 
on Muslims to return to the pure life as exemplified by the words and 
deeds of the prophet Muhammad. His most important accomplishment 
was the translation of the Qur’an into Persian. After Shah Waliullah’s 
death, his son, Shah Abdul Aziz (1746–1823), continued his work with 
the help of dedicated assistants.

As the Mughal Empire dissolved, it was kept from chaos by the able 
administration of the now-autonomous states that were taken over 
by local governors. But the weakened territory was again vulnerable 
to invasion. In 1735 the Persian king, Nadir Shah (r. 1736–47), took 
advantage of the power vacuum. He acquired European arms, which he 
used in a campaign of conquest of his neighbors to the east and former 
Mughal strongholds. He defeated Kabul and then advanced on Punjab. 
The territory submitted without resistance, but Nadir Shah plundered 
and looted Punjab nonetheless. Lahore was spared carnage after the 
rich inhabitants paid for their city’s safety. Nadir Shah next conquered 
Delhi. He kept Muhammad Shah on the throne as a puppet, receiving 
in return a very rich tribute that included the famed Koh-i-noor dia-
mond and the Peacock Throne of Shah Jahan. But Delhi was not spared 
as Lahore had been, and the city was depopulated between 1738 and 
1739. Karachi, today Pakistan’s major port, was first mentioned in an 
account of Nadir Shah’s officers who made use of the harbor.

THE MUGHAL PERIOD

A decade after Nadir Shah’s incursion, Ahmed Shah Abdali (ca. 
1723–73), an officer under Nadir, followed a similar invasion path, but 
was defeated at Sirhind, in southeast Punjab, by Muhammad Shah’s son. 
The Persians retreated across the Indus. This was the last victory the 
Mughals achieved over foreign invaders. The death of Muhammad Shah 
in 1748 marked the end of Mughal power.

Half a dozen more Mughals took the throne after Muhammad Shah, 
but they presided over an empire in name alone, continuously shrink-
ing and losing power, under siege by regional rulers and the European 
powers that were increasingly gaining power over the subcontinent.

TRADING COMPANY WARS 

(1748–1858)

European powers had been competing with one another since the 
16th century to gain control of the Asian trade routes that bypassed 

the Arabs, who had long dominated the commerce. In the mid-18th 
century one power achieved hegemony: Britain. Over the next century 
the English East India Company (EIC), under the patronage of the 
Crown, would establish control over the subcontinent, its objectives 
often achieved by military force. The British saw domination of the 
subcontinent as a national destiny, a God-given mandate similar to the 
conviction that fueled Islamic warriors in spreading their religion. But 
the British goals were political and mercantile. They sought to establish 
the subcontinent as a larder for their resource-starved homeland and to 
block competing European powers from establishing footholds in the 
region.

Having bested Portugal, Holland, and France in claiming dominance 
on the subcontinent, the British established supremacy over native 
powers with the defeat of the Mughal forces at the Battle of Plassey 
in Bengal in 1757. Though the Mughal Empire would survive for 
another century, it was increasingly subservient to Britain’s agenda, 
which included reforms in government and society that remain a part 
of Pakistan today. Yet British influence and rule incited deep animosity, 
culminating in the Indian, or Sepoy, Rebellion, also called the Indian 
Mutiny, an uprising that spread across northern India and what is now 
Pakistan. It would lead to direct British control over the subcontinent.

The Battle of Plassey
In the mid-1700s, the chartered European trading companies in Asia 
and the Pacific transformed their trading posts into fortresses. With 
their parent nations engaged in political and military skirmishing in

TRADING COMPANY WARS

Europe, this was done as much to defend against each other as to fend 
off Maratha attacks. In 1756 Siraj-ud-Daula (r. 1733–57), the young 
nawab of Bengal, as the region’s Muslim rulers were known, ordered 
the Europeans to dismantle their fortifications. All but the British 
complied. In response, Siraj seized the English trading post at Kassim 
Bazaar and laid siege to the British post at Calcutta (Kolkata). After 
four days, the English commander there fled with some of his men, 
abandoning the rest of the garrison. Those left behind were captured 
and put in the post’s stockade. According to a survivor, by the next day 
123 of 146 prisoners had suffocated. (Some historians have questioned 
the reliability of his account.) The stockade became known as the 
Black Hole of Calcutta. The few British who escaped Calcutta spent six 
months waiting for rescue at Diamond Harbor, where many succumbed 
to disease.

During this time the British were actively engaged in countering 
French power throughout the world. On the subcontinent French hold-
ings included settlements on the southeast and southwest coasts and in 
Ceylon (today’s Sri Lanka) as well as in Bengal. Their headquarters were 
at Pondicherry, on the southeast coast. As part of the British Crown’s 
initiative against the French in Pondicherry, a British fleet and army 
happened to be in the harbor at Madras, 100 miles (160 km) north, 
when word of Siraj’s attack was received. The fleet was sent to avenge 
the disaster under the command of Robert Clive (1725–74), a former 
civil servant who had become a military leader in the subcontinent, 
and the troops successfully reconquered British Calcutta in January 
1757. That same year Clive negotiated a treaty with Siraj-ud-Daula 
with more favorable terms for the British and also took the opportu-
nity to destroy the French trading post at Chandernagore (present-day 
Chandannagar).

Despite the new trade agreement with Siraj, Clive desired a more pli-
ant ruler on the throne. Many of the merchants and bankers of Bengal 
also wanted a more business-friendly leader. Clive conspired with 
Siraj-ud-Daula’s opponents, including Mir Jafar, Siraj’s commander in 
chief and father-in-law. Clive organized a small British force to attack 
Siraj-ud-Daula’s army. Fought in a mangrove swamp in Bengal in 1757, 
the Battle of Plassey marked the true beginning of British control of the 
subcontinent. Though far outnumbered, the British possessed supe-
rior cannons, and with deceit wracking Siraj-ud-Daula’s forces, Clive’s 
forces won an easy victory. Siraj-ud-Daula was tracked down and killed, 
and Clive made Mir Jafar the new nawab of Bengal (r. 1757–60). In the 
aftermath of the victory, the British would reap untold riches, while

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

the area, at the time among the most fertile in the world, began to 
experience an economic decline from which it has still not recovered. 
Henceforth the British appointed and discharged the nawabs of Bengal 
at their discretion.

The Carnatic Wars
The victory at Plassey opened the door for more British military con-
quests on the subcontinent. Rather than administer these territories, 
Clive formed alliances with corrupt and malleable local rulers, squeez-
ing them for ever greater profits made on the backs of their increasingly 
downtrodden subjects.

From 1744 to 1763 the British, French, and Marathas engaged in a 
series of military engagements for dominance of the Carnatic, a coastal 
strip in southeast India stretching from just north of Madras to the 
southernmost tip. These were known as the Carnatic Wars. By the end 
of the Second Carnatic War (1748–55), French power in the subconti-
nent had dimmed.

The third and final Carnatic war (1756–63) was a direct outgrowth 
of the Seven Years’ War waged across Europe during those same years. 
A French fleet commanded by Thomas-Arthur, comte de Lally (1702–
66) arrived at the subcontinent in April 1758 to regain control of the 
region. Lally first captured the British headquarters for southern India, 
Fort St. David in Cuddalore, a few miles south of Pondicherry. His next 
goal was Madras. But the French fleet that was to assist him had been 
bloodied in a recent encounter with the British, and the commander 
of the fleet refused to take part in an attack. Meanwhile, lack of pro-
visions and money to pay the troops greatly demoralized the French 
forces, and Lally’s quarrelsome, overbearing manner alienated civil 
authorities. Furthermore his lack of respect for local religious traditions 
antagonized the Indians. By the time he was able to mount his assault 
in 1759, his depleted forces were unable to take the city. Lally sent for 
the marquis de Bussy-Castelnau (ca. 1718–85), who led a French force 
in Hyderabad, to come to his aid. But even with de Bussy’s help Madras 
eluded capture.

Lally and his forces returned to Pondicherry. In 1760 they tried to 
retake their nearby fort at Vandavesi and were defeated by British Lt. 
General Sir Eyre Coote (1726–83) in the Battle of Wandiwash (the 
anglicized version of Vandavesi). It was a defining battle of the war. In 
its aftermath the French were restricted to Pondicherry, where in 1761 
Lally and de Bussy surrendered after a long siege.

In Bengal the British also defeated a Dutch expeditionary force sent to

the nawab they had installed, with the seemingly more pliant Mir 
Qasim (r. 1760–63). With Bengal secure, in 1760 Robert Clive retired to 
England to enjoy the vast fortune he had acquired in the subcontinent. 
As great a profiteer as he had been, the British who took charge of the 
subcontinent for the EIC after Clive were even more rapacious.

By the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War in 1763, the British had all 
but eliminated the French from the subcontinent. Lack of unity among 
local rulers now gave the British an almost free hand in dominating the 
region. Up to this time Europeans had played a relatively small role in 
the economy of the subcontinent. But the demands of the British would 
overwhelm the economy, particularly in Bengal, leading to the famine 
of 1770, one of a series of food shortages that occurred under British 
control that claimed the lives of millions.

The Durrani Empire
While the British were gaining control in Bengal and along the sub-
continent’s coasts, their actions caused little stir in the region that is 
now Pakistan. Here local rulers engaged in power struggles in the wake 
of the collapse of the Mughal Empire. In the power vacuum left by 
the demise of Mughal authority the Marathas, Sikhs, and Afghans all 
sought hegemony in the area that is now Pakistan.

Afghanistan had been under the rule of the shah of Iran, Nadir Shah. 
Following his assassination in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani (ca. 1722–92) 
became the first ruler of Afghanistan’s Durrani Empire. Ahmad Shah led 
eight major military campaigns in the Pakistan area between 1748 and 
1768. In 1757 he seized lands east of the Indus, including Lahore and 
Multan in the Punjab. His son, Prince Timur Shah (r. 1772–93), whom 
he placed in charge of the newly conquered territories, then attacked 
the Sikh’s sacred city of Amritsar. Provoked by the sacrilege, the Sikhs 
seized the region around Lahore and allied themselves with the Mughal 
governor of the Punjab, Adina Beg Khan (d. 1758), who was eager to 
preserve his own power. Adina Beg in turn asked the Marathas to help 
drive off Timur Shah. In 1758 the Marathas and the troops of Adina Beg 
arrived in Lahore, and the Afghan prince retreated westward.

Ahmad Shah Durrani was dealing with a tribal rebellion in Baluchistan 
at the time, but broke off that campaign to counterattack Punjab. 
Though Adina Beg Khan eluded capture by seeking refuge in the nearby 
hill country, awaiting the Afghan emperor’s withdrawal, he died soon 
thereafter. The Marathas returned to Lahore in 1759 to secure the rud-
derless city. But rather than supporting the Mughals, the Marathas sup-

planted them. They reached the height of their power at this time, their 
empire embracing almost all of the subcontinent but for the lands west 
of the Indus; eastern Bengal, which was under British control; and the 
southern tip of the subcontinent, the Mysore kingdom. What is now 
Pakistan was increasingly dominated by the Marathas in the southeast 
and the Afghans in the north and west.

Some in the area preferred the Islamic rule of the Afghan Muslims 
to that of Hindu Marathas from the Deccan. Those who favored the 
Afghans included the influential figures Shah Waliullah, the Islamic 
reformer, and Malika-i-Zamani, the widow of the late Mughal ruler 
Muhammad Shah. Their pledges of support convinced Najib-ud-
Daula (d. 1770), of the Rohilla (literally “mountaineer”) Afghans—
the Pashtun inhabiting the highlands from Swat west to Kabul and 
Kandahar—to form a Muslim Confederacy to cooperate with Ahmad 
Shah Durrani. In 1759 Ahmad Shah Durrani, his army fortified with 
Rohilla Afghan fighters, advanced on Lahore, vanquishing the Marathas 
and expelling them from the Punjab. The armies met two years later 
at Paniput, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Delhi, and again the 
Afghans prevailed, ending Maratha hopes of inheriting the mantle of 
the Mughal Empire. Ahmad Shah Durrani returned to Kabul with his 
army. To secure his conquest of Delhi, he installed Shah Zada, the son 
of the previous Mughal head, Alamgir II (r. 1754–59), as the ruler of 
the ailing Mughal Empire and Oudh, a region of north central India to 
the east of Delhi, giving him the title Shah Alam II (r. 1759–1806). By 
this time the empire had dwindled to Delhi and the surrounding areas. 
Najib-ud-Daula was appointed regent of Delhi. In the ensuing decade 
the area enjoyed some respite from the invasions and battles that had 
characterized its past.

Conflicts in Punjab
Northern Punjab and the Peshawar region were important parts of the 
Durrani empire. However, Ahmad Shah’s rule in Punjab faced ongoing 
opposition and restiveness from the Sikhs, culminating in a Sikh upris-
ing in 1760 and 1761. After suppressing the rebellion, Ahmad Shah 
allowed the Sikh chief Ala Singh (1691–1765) to rule in east Punjab.

In 1762 Ahmad Shah annexed Kashmir, bringing the Durrani empire 
to the height of its power and size. He used existing tribal structure to 
administer his domain, while major decisions were made by a council 
of sardars, a Punjabi term for “chiefs” or “leaders.” But Sikh opposition 
in the Punjab continued. That same year Ahmad Shah, fearful of losing

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

his Indian territory to the restive Sikhs, launched a campaign to not 
merely defeat but to exterminate the Sikhs. This only united the Sikh 
community and strengthened their resolve to resist Afghan rule. In 
1764 the Sikhs attacked Lahore, dividing it among their three conquer-
ing chiefs. Lahore would remain under Sikh rule until the arrival of the 
British in 1849.

In 1773 Ahmad Shah Durrani died, succumbing to the cancer that 
had already forced him to relinquish most of his administrative duties. 
His death ended Afghan dreams of an empire in the mold of the 
Mughals or Persians. His son Timur Shah had taken on the responsi-
bilities of the state. He allowed the Sikhs to continue their control of 
Punjab, recognizing the difficulty of maintaining Afghan rule of the 
region by military means. The empire’s reach simply was not great 
enough. But the lands of the northwestern subcontinent from which 
the Afghans retreated did not automatically fall to the westward expan-
sion of the Sikhs’ dominion. The Sikhs had to defeat the Gakkars, who 
took Rawalpindi, as well as gain the upper head over other local tribes 
and chiefs—often strongly Muslim and staunchly anti-Sikh—who 
sought to establish their own kingdoms.

Rule in Sind and Baluchistan
Sind had long been part of the Mughal Empire, but by the latter half of 
the 17th century local tribes rather than a central authority controlled 
the region. The weak Mughal hold invited periodic raids and efforts 
to exercise dominion by Afghan and Maratha forces. By the begin-
ning of the 18th century the leaders of one Sind tribe, the Kalhora, 
were recognized as rulers of Sind, suzerains of whatever larger power 
claimed the realm. The Kalhora dynasty (r. 1701–83) achieved its 
zenith during the reign of Ghulam Shah Kalhora (r. ca. 1757–72). This 
coincided with the period of Afghanistan’s weakest grip on the region. 
Ghulam’s rule expanded southward to the Arabian Sea. Karachi was 
taken peacefully after he negotiated a land exchange with the khan of 
Kalat in Baluchistan. During this time the Indus River changed course, 
possibly as a result of earthquakes. The shift made much of the Indus 
delta unnavigable, effectively shutting Sind’s port at Shah Bunder. As 
a result the nearby city of Thatta, the capital city, lost its position as a 
major trade center. In about 1768 Ghulam founded a new capital city, 
Hyderabad, located farther north along the new route of the Indus. 
Instability and a bitter civil war between the Kalhoras and the Talpurs, 
a powerful Baluchi tribe, followed Ghulam’s death in 1772.

TRADING COMPANY WARS

In 1773 Timur Shah relocated the capital of the Durrani empire from 
Kandahar to Kabul. This put the empire’s center even further from Sind 
and Baluchistan. Chiefs of Baluchistan, formerly under tight Afghan 
rule, became semi-independent. Indeed, most of what is now Pakistan 
was briefly free of both invasions and the requirement to pay tribute 
to the Afghans, activities that had become the norm over the preced-
ing quarter century. But in the chaos following Ghulam’s death, Sind 
again became the target of Afghan invasions, and tribute payments were 
reinstituted. By 1775 continual warfare made the economic situation in 
Sind so bleak that the British withdrew their merchants from the region. 
The Sindis revolted against Afghan rule in 1779, provoking yet another 
invasion by Afghan forces determined to collect tribute.

Meanwhile local rivals continued battling for rule of Sind as Afghan 
proxies. After a decade of bloodshed, the Talpurs finally defeated the 
Kalhoras at the Battle of Halani in 1782. The Afghan emperor gave them 
a firman, or royal mandate, in 1783 to rule most of Sind, which they 
continued to do until 1843. Five years later, with the Afghan empire in 
further decline, the Talpurs stopped paying tribute. The Afghans con-
tinued trying to collect revenue by force for another 20 years.

Changing British Policies
The region that would become East Pakistan before gaining indepen-
dence as Bangladesh was a center of the British presence on the subcon-
tinent. In 1763 a violent dispute erupted in Bengal between EIC traders 
and their Bengali hosts. Some of the British claimed they were not being 
accorded the trading privileges the Mughal emperor Farukkhsiyar had 
extended to them during his rule 50 years earlier; they believed these 
privileges applied to their personal business dealings as well as to 
those conducted on behalf of the EIC. With Clive back in England, his 
replacement as commander in chief of India, John Caillaud (r. 1760/61), 
negotiated a compromise with Mir Qasim, the British-installed nawab 
of Bengal. The English traders, however, refused to accept the com-
promise. The same year the sepoys the British used as troops mutinied 
for the first time. The British harshly put down the insurrection. Their 
actions provoked Mir Qasim to seek support against the British from 
the Mughal ruler Shah Alam II and the nawab of Oudh, Shuja-ud-Daula 
(r. 1753–75). The forces met at the Battle of Buxar in 1764, where the 
British defeated the Mughal army.

By this time the EIC was facing serious economic problems. 
Individual traders in the company’s employ were becoming wealthy

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

from their private dealings, while the company itself was losing money, 
spent on military campaigns against native rulers and competing 
European powers rather than on trade activities. With turmoil wrack-
ing the EIC, Robert Clive returned to India in 1765. He negotiated a 
peace agreement that granted the British the right of revenue collection 
in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa and brought Oudh into their sphere of 
influence. But Clive’s efforts to rein in the employees’ private dealings 
were deemed insufficient to reverse the company’s fortunes. In an effort 
to trim expenses the company cut the salaries of its European military 
officers, provoking a mutiny. Clive sent some of the rebellious officers 
back to England as prisoners, where he himself returned in 1767.

As EIC agents, eager to amass personal fortunes, plundered the 
subjugated populations of the subcontinent, they showed less dedica-
tion to the EIC’s business, and the company’s profits turned to losses. 
In 1771 the EIC asked the British government for a loan to pay its 
taxes. In 1773 Parliament granted a £1.5 million loan to the EIC and 
passed the Regulating Act of 1773 to gain greater control over the EIC. 
The act placed oversight of the EIC’s operations in the subcontinent 
under a governor-general. Warren Hastings, governor of Bengal, was 
chosen by company directors as the first governor-general of India (r. 
1773–85), charged with reforming the company and restoring profit-
ability. Hastings, who had joined the company as a young clerk, was 
a more enlightened administrator then most of the British of the time, 
knowledgeable and respectful of both Hindu and Muslim cultures. But 

THE BENGAL FAMINE

W hatever reversal of fortune the EIC experienced was minor 
compared to what its policies wrought in Bengal. “Dual Rule,” 

one of Britain’s bedrock policies, put the peasant class under two 
rapacious regimes. Not only were they taxed by the British, who 
received most of the income from all taxes collected, the corrupt and 
servile proxy rulers the British installed taxed the peasants again to 
pay for the running of their own administrations. Between 1756 and 
1770 these policies turned Bengal, a formerly rich and fertile region 
with a sound economy, into an impoverished land where one-third of 
the population died of starvation or accompanying disease. Though 
drought was the immediate cause of the Bengal famine of 1770, British 
policies had left no reserves to alleviate the starvation.

TRADING COMPANY WARS

the Dual Rule policy, whereby peasants in Bengal had to pay taxes both 
to EIC authorities and to local rulers, continued during his tenure, as 
did the periodic famines and dislocation of local economies caused by 
British policies.

The EIC had built its administration on the framework developed by 
the Mughals. Revenues were collected by representatives of the regional 
rulers the EIC supported or installed. The British had also adopted 
the Mughals’ legal system to apply to their subjects. Under Mughal 
tradition Muslims and Hindus were subject to the laws prescribed by 
their respective religions. As part of his administrative reform efforts 
Hastings tried to incorporate these indigenous legal codes into British 
laws for the subcontinent. But Mughal jurisprudence was based on the 
ability of judges to know and interpret the law on a case-by-case basis. 
As adapted by the British, the new law was incapable of capturing 
such nuance, and it institutionalized differences between Muslims and 
Hindus that had previously been more malleable.

Efforts to overhaul jurisprudence would take their largest step with 
the British parliament’s Charter Act of 1833, considered the beginning 
of legal reform in the subcontinent. Though its primary purpose was 
to recertify the administrative authority of the East India Company, the 
act also created the framework for codification of laws, based on the 
British model of justice, throughout India. It also guaranteed rights of 
the indigenous population, stipulating, for example, that no Indian in 
the employ of the EIC could be barred from any office in the company 
due to religion, place of birth, descent, or color.

The Government of Charles Cornwallis
British general Charles Cornwallis, whose defeat at Yorktown in the 
American Revolution had effectively given the American colonies their 
freedom, replaced Hastings as the EIC’s governor-general (r. 1786–93, 
1805). He brought order to British affairs and won salary increases for 
EIC officers to compensate for the rules barring them from engaging 
in extortion and illegal trading. The gulf separating the British and 
the locals grew. The British and the Mughal aristocracy shared mutual 
interests in trade, sports, and ceremonial ritual, but the EIC’s upper 
ranks were closed to locals of any status, further isolating the British 
from both the masses and the upper-class Indians.

Cornwallis ignored diplomacy in favor of political maneuvering. 
Hyderabad, the capital of the kingdom of Golconda, in southeastern 
India (not to be confused with the city in Sind of the same name), 
was ruled by a dynasty whose monarchs took the title nizam, or 

103

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

nizam-ul-mulk, administrator of the realm. The nizam of Hyderabad, 
Asaf Jah II (r. 1762–1803), gave territory to Cornwallis in return 
for the use of local Deccan troops in British employ for his war (r. 
1782–99) with Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, a Hindu kingdom 
that dominated southern India. In retaliation for their support Tipu 
Sultan (r. 1782–99) attacked the British, and Cornwallis ultimately 
took command of the British forces. The British allied themselves 
with the Marathas as well, turning the tide of the conflict. In March 
1792 Tipu Sultan capitulated, agreeing to give up half his territories, 
return prisoners of war, pay war reparations, and surrender two of 
his sons as hostages. His lands were distributed to the EIC and its 
allies.

In an attempt to stimulate agricultural production and create a 
landowning class, Cornwallis introduced the Permanent Settlement of 
land taxes. The Permanent Settlement fixed tax rates for agricultural 
land, freeing landowners from concerns that increased production 
would result in higher taxes. However, droughts occurring soon after 
the new tax law was adopted made it impossible for them to pay what 
they owed. They were forced to sell their land to absentee landlords 
who were more interested in making quick profits than in long-term 
increases in productivity.

British Interests in the Pakistan Region
The EIC had trading posts on the west coast of the subcontinent as 
well as on the east. The west coast settlements were primarily com-
mercial enterprises, largely uninvolved in political matters, unlike 
those in Bengal and Madras. It was not until the late 1700s that the 
British gained a political interest in what is today Pakistan, aroused by 
Afghanistan and its hold on the region.

With the relocation of the Afghan capital from Kandahar to Kabul, 
the frontier, and the Peshawar region in particular, took on critical 
importance to the Durrani empire. Timur Shah escaped an attempt on 
his life in Peshawar in 1791 and executed the chief of the Mohmands, a 
Pashtun tribe living in southeastern Afghanistan (now the NWFP), for 
his role in the plot. However, the Sikh rulers of Lahore and Rawalpindi 
were firmly in the Afghans’ orbit. The kahn of Kalat recognized Afghan 
suzerainty as well, as did other local rulers in Baluchistan and Persian 
Khorasan. Timur Shah died of natural causes in 1793, leaving no desig-
nated successor despite having several sons. Another period of instabil-
ity ensued. Zaman Shah (r. 1793–1800), Timur’s fifth son, succeeded

his father and soon launched a campaign against the Talpur chief of 
Sind, Mir Fath Khan (r. 1783–1802), to collect overdue tribute. But 
trouble stirred by an elder brother, Mahmud, required Zaman to negoti-
ate a hasty agreement with the Talpurs and quickly return home.

Lord Mornington, the marquis of Wellesley, the new British gover-
nor-general (r. 1797–1805), reestablished the British trading presence 
in Sind in order to monitor the area. Karachi had by now overtaken 
Thatta’s position as the area’s premier port. Once the Indus changed 
course, and the delta began to silt up, Thatta could no longer provide a 
gateway to and from the region’s interior. Additionally Karachi was less 
rigidly controlled than Thatta, where Sindi officials were rigorous in 
their enforcement of trade rules, collecting tariffs and duties on all goods 
coming or going through the city and anywhere in the territory. Karachi 
had been alternately ruled by the Kalat, Kalhoras, and Talpurs, and the 
trade routes to Afghanistan from here passed through Baluchistan rather 
than Sind, making it preferable to the British. The agents engaged in the 
political mission in Sind discovered rich economic opportunities, and 
their report extolled the bustling activity of Karachi’s port. But unlike 
the welcome originally accorded the British in Bengal on the east coast, 
local merchants had resisted foreign presence going back to the time

of the Portuguese 250 years before. The locals refused to do business 
or associate socially with the Europeans. The British representatives 
sought a meeting with Sind’s ruler, Mir Fath Khan, to gain his support, 
and they were granted permission to open a factory. However, within 
a year of establishing their factory in 1799, Mir Fath Khan ordered it 
closed, concerned about the British reputation for seizing power and 
working against local merchants.

By this time the glory days of the khan of Kalat were over. Its most 
heralded ruler, Naseer Khan Baluch (r. 1749–94), had died in 1794. 
Local principalities such as Karachi, Las Bela, Kharan, Jhalawan, and 
others mounted periodic insurrections against Kalat. Thus British inter-
est in Pakistan’s economic and political potential was growing at a time 
when Pakistan was without a dominant power.

The Sikhs in Punjab
Any hopes the Sikhs harbored of being done with the Afghans ended 
with an invasion marshaled by Zaman Shah in 1795, followed by 
similar incursions in 1797 and 1798. In 1799 Zaman Shah survived an 
assassination attempt in Peshawar, and like his father, had the plotters, 
in this case Barakzai tribal chiefs, executed. In Punjab the absence of 
outside authority ignited a power struggle among local chiefs. By 1800 
most of the 12 Sikh misls, or divisions of the Dal Khalsa, the Sikh army, 
had staked out land for fiefdoms. (The word khalsa, from the Arabic 
for “pure,” was used by Muslim rulers to signify state lands; later, Sikhs 
used the term to mean practicing members of the faith, after which it 
was applied to their military force and soldiers.) Half of these fiefdoms 
were in what is now Pakistan. Most of Pakistan’s Punjabi territory was 
ruled by local Muslim aristocracies. Some of these ruling families, of 
Pashtun descent, had roots in the area that dated back centuries, while 
others came during more recent invasions.

One of the most powerful Punjabi rulers, Ranjit Singh (r. 1801–39), 
was also one of the most unlikely. A small man—illiterate, blind in one 
eye, his face scarred by small pox—Ranjit Singh inherited lands in the 
Gujranwala area, north of Lahore, initially acquired by his grandfather, 
a Sikh chief allied with Ahmad Shah Durrani at Amritsar. Ranjit’s father 
had led the border chiefs who extended Sikh rule to the Margalla Pass 
(between Islamabad and Taxila) and Hasan Abdal in northern Punjab 
during Zaman Shah’s reign.

Ranjit was 12 years old in 1791 when his father died. He took part 
in raids the following year, and his stature among the Sikhs grew.

TRADING COMPANY WARS

Ranjit fought Zaman Shah’s first invasion of the Punjab, but as much 
a diplomat as a warrior, he helped negotiate the latter’s retreat from 
Punjab. When cannons were lost in a river during Zaman’s withdrawal, 
Ranjit retrieved and returned some of them to Afghanistan. In gratitude 
Zaman awarded him Lahore, though the Afghan ruler’s hold on the 
city was weak. The chiefs who ruled Lahore, and their sons, refused to 
give up the city, but the local elite opened Lahore’s gates and welcomed 
Ranjit, and he took over the city in 1799. Meanwhile, the power of the 
Sikh armies was increasingly impinging on the sovereignty of Punjab’s 
Muslim chieftains.

At the beginning of the 19th century a nascent power struggle in the 
Punjab pitted Ranjit Singh against four allied Sikh chiefs from Amritsar, 
Gujarat, Wazirabad, and Ramgaon, along with the Muslim leader of 
Kasur. The alliance foundered with the death of Amritsar’s ruler, and 
his army disbanded. But his widow, who inherited his position, assem-
bled an army. Ranjit sought sovereignty over all Sikhs, and control of 
Amritsar, their holiest city, was essential for his quest. In 1802 the three 
other Sikh chiefs allied themselves with Ranjit in defeating the widow’s

forces. Over the next two decades Amritsar’s fortunes improved as 
Ranjit rebuilt its temple and improved its fortifications.

During the first years of the century the Marathas were engaged in 
battles with the British across the subcontinent. The Holkar, a powerful 
central Indian state and member of the Maratha confederation, sought 
an alliance with Ranjit against the British. Determined not to be on the 
wrong side in the war, in 1806 Ranjit instead signed a treaty with the 
British pledging not to aid the Holkar. In return the British promised 
not to interfere with the internal affairs of Ranjit’s territory, leaving him 
free to expand his empire. Among his first subsequent conquests was 
Kasur, in 1807, a city about 55 miles (80 km) southeast of Lahore. Not 
only was it of cultural importance to Muslims, the city had long resisted 
the Sikhs. Such was Ranjit’s growing power that in 1808 rival Sikh 
chiefs asked the British Resident—the EIC representative—in Delhi to 
prohibit Ranjit from attacking them. The British would soon have their 
own reasons for checking Ranjit’s expansion.

International Affairs
In July 1798 French general Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt with 
the goal of cutting off England from India. A year later, in May 1799, 
the British fought their last battle against Tipu Sultan, defeating him 
at his fortress at Seringapatam, on an island of the same name in the 
Cauvery River. The British were now the major power in much of India, 
a position cemented by Napoleon’s defeat in Syria that same month, 
ending the French threat to the British position in the subcontinent.

However, in 1807 Russia and a resurgent France signed a treaty to 
cooperate against the EIC’s possessions. By 1808 the French army was 
advancing on Persia; Sindi rulers had granted the French access to 
their ports. The British mounted a diplomatic counterattack, dispatch-
ing envoys throughout the region, including Sind, Baluchistan, the 
Punjab, and Afghanistan. Ranjit Singh was, of course, on the list for 
visits. He welcomed the approaching envoys by mounting a display of 
force, attacking Amritsar, Ambala, and Patiala in Punjab. Ranjit hoped 
his campaign would pressure the British into recognizing him as the 
leader of the Sikhs as well pledging nonintervention in actions he 
undertook in Afghanistan, in return for supporting the British against 
the French. But by the time the envoys reached Ranjit, the British felt 
less threatened by the French and were more interested in suppressing 
the growth of regional powers such as Ranjit represented. Siding with 
the other Sikh rulers, they forbade Ranjit from expanding his empire

by force anywhere but northwest of the Sutlej River. Ranjit prepared 
to resist the ultimatum, gathering his forces at Ludhiana (in today’s 
Indian state of Punjab) for a showdown with the British, but then 
agreed to a treaty rather than fight. The 1809 Treaty of Amritsar that 
Ranjit signed left the Sikh community permanently divided. Some were 
vehemently opposed to capitulation to British demands and preferred 
a military response. Others felt Ranjit had taken a prudent course 
that preserved the kingdom. That same year statesman and historian 
Mountstuart Elphinstone (1779–1859), the first Englishman to visit 
Peshawar, went to the court of Shuja Shah Durrani, the Afghan ruler (r. 
1803–09, 1839–42). Elphinstone was impressed with the reception and 
the tribal jirga, or council system of village government. (The clan jirga 
was called khel, and the loya jirga advised the emir of Kabul.) A few 
weeks after Elphinstone’s visit, Shuja Shah was deposed by his brother 
Mahmud, who had previously ruled the kingdom. For the next 42 years 
Shuja Shah tried to regain the throne. His claims to the kingdom were 
used by Ranjit Singh and later the British to justify their own actions 
against the Durrani empire, which they claimed were undertaken on 
Shuja’s behalf.

From 1809 to 1819 Ranjit Singh annexed all the territories allowed 
by his treaty with the British. Ever the opportunist, he conquered inde-
pendent Muslim areas, claiming to be acting on behalf of the Durrani 
empire, though he kept most of the spoils of his conquests for himself. 
He did, however, mount a cooperative mission with Mahmud’s Afghan 
forces to punish Kashmir for supporting one of Shuja Shah’s attempts 
to regain his throne. The Afghans were the first to conclude a peace 
agreement with Kashmir and collect tribute, which they later refused 
to share with Ranjit’s Sikh forces. But the Sikhs defeated the Afghans 
in the Battle of Haidaru in 1813, and in 1814 Rawalpindi came under 
Ranjit’s rule.

The Jihad
Muslim reform efforts continued after the death of Islamic scholar 
and activist Shah Waliullah, carried on by his son and spiritual heir, 
Shah Abdul Aziz Muhaddith Dehlavi (1746–1823), and others. The 
downturn of the fortunes of the subcontinent’s Muslims mirrored the 
decline of the Mughal Empire. In the early 19th century efforts by 
Christian missionaries to convert Muslims, and the loss of lands they 
had controlled for centuries to the Sikhs, roiled the Islamic commu-
nity. Shah Waliullah’s call for spiritual jihad, or holy struggle to live

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

more piously, was now being supplanted by the military jihad urged by 
his descendants. Although Waliullah too had endorsed holy wars, he 
had directed Muslim rulers of his era to wage battle against the Hindu 
kingdoms; now Sikhs were the target of Muslim militancy. After Ranjit’s 
conquest of Rawalpindi in 1810, rumors spread that the Sikhs were 
persecuting and attacking Muslims in Punjab. In response Shah Abdul 
Aziz launched a jihad. Sayyid Ahmad Barelwi (1786–1831), a military 
and religious leader noted for his organizational skills, was appointed 
to run the movement. Muslim mujahideens, or holy warriors, gathered 
throughout the region of today’s Pakistan. Bands of volunteers made 
their way through Bahwalpur, Sind, and Baluchistan. In Peshawar, they 
overran and captured the town.

Ranjit Singh sent an army under the command of Jean-Baptiste 
Ventura (ca. 1792–?), a French mercenary of indeterminate back-
ground whom Ranjit had made a general, against the mujahideens. 
Meanwhile, his agents spread rumors claiming that Ahmad Barelwi’s 
reforms were un-Islamic and that he was a Wahhabi, a practitioner of 
a rigid form of Islam. (Wahhabism is followed in contemporary Saudi 
Arabia.) Other potential supporters were bought off with bribes and 
presents. The jihad began to lose support. Many Afghans deserted, and 
local Pathan chiefs killed many of the mujahideens, seeking either eco-
nomic or spiritual gain. Ahmad Barelwi was driven to the foothills of 
Kashmir, and on May 6, 1831, at a battle at Balakat, Ahmad Barelwi and 
many of the movement’s leaders were killed and his army vanquished. 
The movement went underground and continued to foment anti-Hindu 
and, increasingly, anti-British sentiment.

British Wars in Afghanistan
With the Russians continuing to make overtures to Afghanistan, 
George Eden, first earl of Auckland (1784–1849), arrived from England 
with orders to install a pro-British regime to keep the Russians at bay. 
He dispatched an army that marched through Sind on the way to 
Afghanistan, ignoring a treaty with the Mirs, as the Talpur chieftains of 
Sind were known. The 1832 treaty forbade passage of British forces or 
military stores along the Indus River or across Sind. Lord Auckland’s 
army joined another British force in Baluchistan. Once in Kabul the 
British installed their puppet, Shuja Shah, on the throne, but in 1841, 
while the British were on their way back to Jalalabad, near the Khyber 
Pass, a rebellion broke out. The retreating British forces were attacked, 
and most were slaughtered. Lord Auckland was recalled to England,

TRADING COMPANY WARS

though not much changed under his replacement, Edward Law, earl of 
Ellenborough (r. 1842–44). The British returned to Afghanistan to take 
Ghazni and Kabul, then withdrew. This marked the conclusion of the 
First Afghan War, which lasted from 1839 to 1842.

The Mirs of Sind allowed the British to penetrate their territory 
unimpeded. Perhaps emboldened by the lack of protest, the British 
forced a new, more onerous treaty on the Mirs, reducing their property 
and income. Sir James Outram (1803–63) was sent from England to 
enforce the treaty. The Mirs protested strongly, but their objections were 
met with a brutal British response from an army dispatched by Lord 
Ellenborough under the command of Sir Charles Napier (1782–1853). 
The British assault sparked an uprising in Baluchistan that culminated 
in an attack on the British residency in Hyderabad, Sind. Napier used 
the attack as a pretense to attack the rebel forces nearby at Miani and 
Dabo (1842–43), thereby conquering Sind. The Mirs were exiled, and 
Napier became Sind’s first British governor, provoking the anger of 
Muslims and Hindus alike.

The Sikh Wars
Ranjit Singh died in 1839. After his death Punjab fell into chaos under 
the brief reigns of a succession of rulers. In response to the anarchy of 
the post-Ranjit years, the army played a growing role in political affairs. 
The degree to which the EIC was seeking an excuse to gain more con-
trol in the region has been debated, as has the notion that it was only 
concerned about the effects of instability on its nearby settlements. But 
whatever the EIC’s motives, the Sikh army’s growing assertiveness pro-
vided a spark that ignited armed conflict between the British and the 
Sikhs known as the Anglo-Sikh, or, simply, Sikh Wars.

Ranjit Singh had signed a treaty with the EIC pledging to keep 
Sikh forces northwest of the Sutlef River. As the Sikh kingdom began 
to crumble, the EIC had built up its military forces along the river, 
to which the Sikhs objected. After negotiations broke down, and the 
EIC sent a large force to reinforce the area, in late 1845 the Sikh army 
crossed the Sutlef, igniting the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845–46).

The Sikh army was well equipped and had been trained by European 
mercenaries. Still, ultimately the British resoundly defeated the Sikh 
army, and the war officially ended with the Treaty of Lahore, signed in 
March 1846. Under the terms of the treaty the Sikhs paid the British an 
indemnity and ceded them Kashmir, and the British kept the current 
ruler, Ranjit’s son, the young Dalip Singh (r. 1843–49) on the throne.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

But the British Resident controlled policy. The Sikh’s army was reduced 
to 20,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, retained primarily to keep the 
region from falling to Afghanistan. The British sold Kashmir to Raja 
Gulab Singh for 8 million rupees, the equivalent of about US$2,640,000 
at the time.

The defeat, terms of the treaty, and British presence bred anger and 
resentment among many Sikhs. In August 1848 Sikh forces stationed 
in Hazara, in what is now Pakistan’s NWFP, rebelled, as did those in 
Multan the next month when the British tried to choose the successor 
to the ruler of the Sikh territory. Two British officers sent to Multan to 
install the EIC-backed governor were killed, precipitating the Second 
Sikh War (1848–49). The Sikhs initially won several battles, but the 
British rebounded to win a decisive victory under the command of Lord 
Hugh Gough (1779–1869), formerly Sir Hugh. The uprising ended 
with a second Treaty of Lahore, signed March 9, 1849, under which 
the Sikhs ceded Punjab to the British, and the Sikh army was dis-
banded. Raja Dalip Singh moved to England in 1854. Sir John Lawrence 
(1811–79), later Lord Lawrence, was named chief commissioner of the 
Jullundur district, in today’s Indian state of Punjab.

The British were led at the time by James Broun Ramsay, first mar-
quis of Dalhousie (r. 1848–56). Young, short-tempered, and arrogant, 
Lord Dalhousie had boundless energy and willpower despite his frail 
constitution. Convinced of the superiority of Western ways and the 
need for British rule on the subcontinent, he pursued a policy of 
bringing princely states under British rule through the doctrine of 
lapse. According to this policy rulers without sons and under the 
direct control, or paramountcy, of Great Britain surrendered their 
right to appoint a successor to the British. This alienated the feudal 
aristocracy and sparked a revolt by deposed princes. British support 
for missionaries, who were seen by some as corrupting Hindu reli-
gious and cultural traditions, exacerbated popular opposition to the 
British. Hindus also objected to the mixing of religions and castes in 
prison, which was contrary to their faith, as well as to laws prohib-
iting sati, the practice of burning widows alive on their husbands’ 
funeral pyres. Muslims were angered by the exclusion of Arabic and 
Persian from schools.

However, under the modernization efforts spearheaded by Dalhousie, 
roads, schools, and canals were built. British administrators John 
Lawrence in Punjab and the frontier, and Henry Bartle Frere (1815–84) 
in Sind and Baluchistan, played a large role in these projects. Sikh lead-
ers were given jagirs, and relations with them gradually normalized.

Only the Muslim state of Oudh, now part of Utter Pradesh in north 
India, was still intact, the last vestige of the Mughal Empire. This too 
would be annexed by the British. First, though, the growing antipathy 
toward the British and their policies would erupt in an uprising. The 
short-lived Indian Revolution would profoundly change British gov-
ernance in the subcontinent and further set back the fortunes of its 
Muslim population.

THE RAJ ERA (1858–1909)

The Sepoy Rebellion, or Indian Mutiny—the culmination of grow-
ing resentment and anger toward the British and their policies—

marked a turning point in the subcontinent’s history. In its aftermath 
the British Crown dissolved the EIC and assumed direct control 
over Indian territories. This ushered in the era referred to as the Raj. 
Under colonial rule the British attempted to introduce some forms of 
democratic institutions while simultaneously denying the people of the 
subcontinent any meaningful representation in the government. The 
Raj was also the period when seeds of an independent Pakistan were 
sown. Upper-class Muslims were living in economic and political isola-
tion due to British perception of their support for the Sepoy Rebellion. 
Concurrently nationalist sentiment grew throughout the region and 
coalesced in 1885 in the foundation of a united independence move-
ment led by the Indian National Congress. As the independence move-
ment grew, so did divisions between Hindus and Muslims. A call for a 
separate Muslim state was heard, along with the rising demand for the 
subcontinent’s independence from Britain, exemplified by the forma-
tion of the Muslim League. In 1909 Muslims gained a greater voice 
with the Government of India Act, also known as the Morley-Minto 
Reforms, marking a crucial juncture in Pakistan’s history.

The Sepoy Rebellion
British control over the subcontinent had grown incrementally. The 
patchwork of states and fiefdoms that comprised the subcontinent’s 
political landscape enabled the British to pursue a divide-and-conquer 
strategy, pitting ruler against ruler and lord against his subjects. It also 
allowed the British to rely on Indian troops for the great majority of its 
military force in the region, a weapon that played an important role in 
establishing Britain’s rule. The ethnic and cultural diversity of the sub-

THE RAJ ERA

continent and its history of internal warfare minimized the potential for 
the indigenous population to unite against the British. But a confluence 
of events finally ignited anti-British sentiment across the subcontinent, 
leading to sufficient unity against the British and thus the outbreak of 
the Sepoy Rebellion in 1858.

Roots of Rebellion
Britain’s Indian troops, called sepoys, were divided into three main 
armies, headquartered in Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. The soldiers had 
been periodically restive since the beginning of the century. The Madras 
army had revolted in 1806 in Vellore, in what is now southern India, 
after changes in dress code that offended native religious sensibilities 
were instituted. Hats made of leather, a material forbidden to Hindus, 
who venerate cattle, were issued to the troops for headgear, while 
Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their mustaches. 
The Bengal army, which had many high-caste Hindu troops, mutinied 
four times between 1843 and 1856 over a variety of grievances. During 
the 1840s, the British led troops from Bengal into newly annexed Sind 
and Punjab. But high-caste Hindu troops objected to crossing the Indus 
River, since this crossing traditionally resulted in a loss of caste. The 
sepoys also chaffed at the gradual loss of their overseas allowances, paid 
for serving across borders; the extra pay provided important financial 
support for their families while soldiers were away on duty. As more 
previously foreign territories were annexed, the sepoys increasingly 
served within their own borders, no matter how far from home their 
mission. And there were some theaters of operation—for example 
Burma, with its unpleasant jungles—where sepoys simply did not want 
to serve.

Numerous other causes for complaint existed. British officers often 
made a conscious effort to evince their own superiority, while humili-
ating local soldiers. And the Crimean War (1853–56), which pitted 
France, Britain, and the Ottoman Empire against Russia, had decimated 
the ranks of seasoned British officers, leaving less experienced and 
capable commanders in their place. At the same time, the British army’s 
requirement that new officers study the native languages were dropped, 
further distancing British officers from Indian troops.

In February 1856 Charles Canning, first earl Canning (r. 1856–62), 
replaced Lord Dalhousie as governor-general of India. The hard-line 
policies Lord Dalhousie had championed—“lapse” and “paramountcy,” 
annexation, and economic exploitation—had helped sow the seeds of

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

anger and discontent that drove the Sepoy Rebellion. That same year 
the British instituted a mandatory deployment policy that required 
troops to serve wherever ordered in the empire; it was aimed at troops 
refusing to serve in Burma. Other military policies perceived by sepoys 
as anti-Hindu were also announced.

“Biting the Bullet”
In January 1857 the British gave Indian troops cartridges for their 
newly issued Enfield rifles. Sepoys had been taught to bite the tips 
of the cartridges before loading to prepare them for firing. Muslims 
thought the grease on the cartridges tasted of forbidden pork fat, while, 
to the Hindus, the grease smelled of cattle, which were sacred to them. 
Soldiers at Dum Dum, near Calcutta, refused to use the cartridges. 
Soon the resistance spread. Though animal fat was indeed used as 
lubrication, the British denied the fact and attempted to force use of 
the bullets. The British command surrounded groups of sepoys with 
British artillery and ordered them to “bite the bullet.” Soldiers who 
refused—and most did—were immediately separated, stripped of their 
insignia, and dismissed without pay. They had to walk home to their 
villages, in some cases hundreds of miles away.

The British finally allowed soldiers to supply their own grease and 
rescinded the order that cartridges had to be bitten. But unrest among 
troops across northern India simmered. Fires of mysterious origin 
broke out on army bases. Some units mutinied, others were disbanded 
by the British to preclude uprisings. Oudh was a scene of particular 
restiveness, the result of a British-mandated inspection of landholdings, 
viewed by the indigenous population as a veiled effort to expropriate 
native property. EIC Resident Sir Henry Montgomery Lawrence (1806–
57) was dispatched to Oudh as part of the inspection and established a 
residency at its capital, Lucknow, in March.

Rebellion Begins
At Meerut, in north central India, 85 soldiers had been incarcerated 
earlier for refusing to bite the bullet. On May 10, 1857, while the British 
officers were in church, the sepoys revolted, freeing their imprisoned 
comrades. After killing several officers they marched to Delhi, 30 
miles (48 km) south, where they were met by other Indian troops who 
joined the insurrection. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah II (r. 
1838–58), was then 82 years old, and his authority was limited by the 
British and largely confined to Delhi, but he was the one figure behind

whom both Muslim and Hindu could unite. The rebellious troops asked 
Bahadur Shah II to lead a campaign for restoration of Mughal rule, and 
he agreed. With most of the European forces off fighting the Crimean 
and Persian wars (the latter fought with Persia over Afghanistan in 
1856–57), their ranks between Bengal and Meerut were thinned, and the 
British began disarming native troops. Lucknow, Agra (in north central 
India), Lahore, Peshawar, and Mardan (in what is now the NWFP) were 
among the places were the sepoys were relieved of their weapons.

On May 13, 3,600 Indian troops were disarmed in Lahore and put 
under the guard of 400 Europeans, augmented by Sikh troops. The 
Sikhs had suffered defeats in the two Sikh wars at the hands of British-
led Indian troops, so they had little sympathy or fondness for either the 
Indian troops or the Mughal emperor the troops supported. Meanwhile, 
British interception of sepoy mail revealed that troops were communi-
cating with followers of Sayyid Ahmad Barelwi, the late revolutionary 
Islamist, in Swat and Sithana (in north central India), and that the 
Sithana revolutionaries in turn were in communication with mutineers 
in Bengal. In response the British sent the Bengal Native Infantry across 
the subcontinent to the edge of the tribal area, where they would have 
more difficulty inciting or drawing support from locals. Still, the revolt 
expanded and by late May had spread as far as Bombay. The Corps of 
Guides, made up of Indian troops loyal to the British, was dispatched 
to meet and reinforce the British forces in the Delhi area. A few weeks 
later some Indian soldiers at Mardan and Nowshera (in today’s NWFP) 
refused orders. Both forces were disarmed, an action some British offi-
cers strongly opposed, feeling the loyalty of all the troops had been 
unfairly maligned by the actions of a few. Some of these British officers 
gave up their own swords and spurs in protest. Two of the deserting 
Mardan sepoys were captured in the Hazara District in the frontier 
region a few weeks later. On June 13, they were blown from the mouths 
of cannons as an example before a large assembly.

Most of the Mardan troops were eventually executed. The north area 
now seemed secure. Sir John Lawrence (1811–79), chief commissioner 
of Punjab and brother of Sir Henry Lawrence, considered asking Dost 
Mohammed Khan, ruler of Afghanistan (r. 1818–39, 1843–63), to take 
control of Peshawar, which would have freed the Europeans to go to 
Delhi. But the senior officers felt the British would lose face by request-
ing such help. Lord Canning agreed, sending an urgent message on 
the new telegraph line that instructed the British commander to hold 
Peshawar at all costs. The British, meanwhile, had taken to keeping 
pistols by their sides at mealtime and in church.

In Lucknow, which was the center of the rebellion, the Europeans had 
been besieged since early June, as they were in Kanpur, on the Ganges 
in north central India. On July 16 some 400 European residents of 
Kanpur, promised safe passage downriver, were instead shot and 
hacked to death in a spasm of violence. British troops recaptured the 
city the following day.

In July 1857 mutinies broke out in Sialkot and Jhelum in Punjab and 
in other cities. On July 30, a violent dust storm swept Lahore, where 
the 26th Native Infantry had been under detention for three months. 
During the storm the British commander was killed, and the incarcer-
ated troops were liberated. Most fled, and the few who remained were 
killed by the British, as were those who surrendered the following day. 
Some 500 sepoys were executed within two days. Others were sent to 
Lahore and executed by cannon fire. Sir John Lawrence and Robert 
Montgomery (1809–87), lieutenant-governor of Punjab, commended 
the executions. Still the revolt spread. A British attempt to retake 
Lucknow was unsuccessful, and the revolt continued through the fall.

The rebels’ most able military leader was Lakshmibai (ca. 1828–58), 
the queen, or rani, of Jhansi, a Maratha state in North India. Sir Hugh 
Rose (1801–85), British army field marshal, considered her the most 
dangerous of all rebel leaders due to her bravery, cleverness, and perse-
verance. She died in battle against Sir Hugh’s forces at Gwalior in north 
central India, ending her threat.

The decisive battle of the insurrection was waged at Kanpur, scene of 
the massacre of British citizens the previous December. The British, led 
by Commander-in-Chief Colin Campbell (1792–1863), defeated Tantia 
Topi (1814–59), commander of the rebel forces. Following the victory, 
the British razed villages in retribution for the slaughter.

The End of the Revolt
Fighting continued into 1858, but the rebellion failed, and with it the 
last hope to drive out the foreign interlopers from the subcontinent. 
On July 8, 1858, Lord Canning proclaimed peace. The subcontinent 
was left in chaos. Several factors contributed to the revolt’s failure. 
There was no central command. The spontaneous eruption of hatred 
and anger, powerful though it was, had no organization or coordinated 
way to channel its energy. The insurrectionists failed to mount any form 
of guerrilla warfare. What leaders they had were dethroned princes 
eager for return to old feudal ways, rather than enlightened figures

with a progressive vision. Moreover, the Westernized, educated classes 
supported the British. And unity was elusive, with some rebels seek-
ing restoration of Mughal power, while others wanted a return of the 
Marathas’ authority.

The British took swift steps to punish those they held responsible 
and to reassert the rule of law. Tantia Topi was captured and hanged in 
April 1859. Emperor Bahadur Shah II was tried and exiled to Burma. 
His sons had already been killed by the British.

The Sepoy Mutiny was especially disastrous for British India’s 
Muslim community. The British assigned them the brunt of the blame 
for the uprising, and subsequently limited opportunities for advance-
ment to Muslims that Hindus of the subcontinent enjoyed, widening 
the chasm between the two societies. A decade after the rebellion, 
British Orientalist William Wilson Hunter (1840–1900) stated:

There is no use shutting our ears to the fact that the Indian 
Muhammedans arraign us on a list of charges as serious as 
have ever been brought against a government . . . They accuse us 
of having closed every honourable walk of life to the professors 
of their creed. They accuse us of having introduced a system of 
education which leaves their whole community unprovided for, 
and which landed it in contempt and beggary. They accuse us of 
having brought misery into thousands of families by abolishing 
their law officers, who gave the sanction of religion to marriage, 
and who from time immemorial have been the depositories 
and administrators of the Domestic Law of Islam. They accuse 
us of imperiling their soul by denying them the means of per-
forming the duties of their faith. Above all, they charge us with 
deliberate malversation of their religious foundations, and with 
misappropriation on the largest scale of their education funds 
(Hunter 969, 145).

Government of India Act of 1858
In the aftermath of the uprising the British reexamined their policies 
toward their colonies. The insurrection was blamed on misrule by the 
EIC, and the British government was now determined to take charge of 
the EIC’s management and operations. The British parliament passed 
the Government of India Act of 1858, creating the position of secretary 
of state for India to whom the governor-general of India would report. 
Previously, the governor-general was under indirect British government 
control, which made it easier for EIC directors and agents to ignore the 
government’s wishes. Henceforth, the governor general, while retaining

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

this title, was also now known as viceroy, and considered a representa-
tive of the British monarch. The act also created councils to draft and 
pass laws with the viceroy’s approval. The governor-general’s coun-
cil was composed of an executive council, which proposed laws for 
British-held areas, and a legislative council, which enacted them. These 
councils were mirrored at the provincial level and were to include 
Indians appointed by the viceroy’s office.

The act vested the British monarch with ultimate authority over the 
subcontinent’s states and Parliament with responsibility for dictating 
their policies. But the viceroys exercised a high degree of independence 
in establishing the tone of their administrations. They would retain 
their role as the titular heads of the subcontinent until its independence 
in 1947.

Lord Canning
Charles John Canning, first earl Canning, who had become governor-
general in 1856, retained his post and became the first viceroy (r. 1858–
62). The military was among the first institutions he reformed in the 
wake of the strife. Lord Canning disbanded the Bengal Army, number-
ing more than 100,000 soldiers (a lakh in the traditional Indian num-
bering system), most from what is now Uttar Pradesh in north central 
India, and many of them Muslim. Loyal Sikhs, Rajputs, and Gurkhas 
(an ethnic group from Nepal and North India) were enlisted in their 
place. The percentage of British personnel in the army was increased, 
and the proportion of high-caste Hindus decreased. Only British troops 
manned artillery. Though all officers were British, a viceroy’s commis-
sion for native recruits introduced three ranks: jemadar, subedar, and 
subedar major. These junior officer ranks gave prestige to locals and 
enabled a better chain of command from officers to troops.

Lord Canning promoted a policy labeled conciliation, aimed at fos-
tering good relations with leading princes and feudal aristocrats. By 
restoring their feudal authority he hoped these proxy powers, by their 
local connection and history, would keep their subjects in check. Even 
rulers of tribes participating in the revolt were restored to power. Lord 
Canning also reversed Dalhousie’s efforts to appropriate feudal prin-
cipalities. The Right of Adoption was restored, allowing feudal rulers 
without natural heirs to adopt one in order to preserve their kingdoms 
after death.

The conciliatory policy of feudal appeasement the British pursued in 
the aftermath of the revolt did not extend to Punjab. The British viewed

Simpson (1823–99) (HIP/Art Resource, NY)

Punjab’s feudal rulers, most of them Hindu, as obstacles to social 
progress, contributing little, taking more than their share in taxes, and 
short-changing the British on their due. The British wanted to levy 
taxes directly on peasants and eliminate the feudal landlords altogether. 
As a result, they gave preference to small landlords in determining 
the outcome of land ownership disputes, and rather than improving 
relations with the land barons in Punjab, the British curtailed their 
power. Peasants working the land, primarily Muslims, sold their crops 
to merchants, who, like the feudal lords, were mostly Hindu. Freed of 
the rulers’ heavy hand, the economy expanded. By the 1870s Hindu 
merchants and other businessmen were developing into a middle class 
in Punjab. Mostly composed of members of lower castes, this emerging 
class sought Western education as a way to better themselves, a path 
eschewed by Muslims. Muslims, already blamed for the revolt, found 
themselves even further estranged from the mainstream of the subcon-
tinent by a growing education gap.

Large numbers of insurrectionists were under detainment at the con-
clusion of the revolt. In 1858 the British reopened the penal colony at

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Port Blair, in the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, to house some 
of them. To appease the upper classes, the Indian Councils Act, passed 
in 1861, added more members to legislative councils in the provinces. 
Indians nominated for membership by the British were from the upper 
classes, chosen for their loyalty to the Crown. In reality the legislative 
councils had no authority over the executive council, which deter-
mined policy. But it furthered the cause of reconciliation, demonstrat-
ing Britain’s desire to make at least cosmetic changes to its rule of the 
subcontinent. Also in 1861 the Indian Penal Code proposed by Thomas 
Babbington Macaulay (1800–59), based on the laws of England, was 
enacted, establishing high courts in major towns.

Lord Canning convened two durbars, or ceremonial gatherings, 
where loyal princes’ rank and titles were affirmed, as was Britain’s 
pledge not to annex their territories. At his second durbar Lord 
Canning read out Queen Victoria’s Proclamation of 1858. Considered 
the first constitutional reform of the British government’s control of 
India, the proclamation expressed a desire to better the lives of all on 
the subcontinent. It promised that the civil service would be open to 
all. However, in practice, high-level administrators selected in England 
served to exclude well-educated Indians from senior positions.

Lord Elgin
In 1862 James Bruce, eighth earl of Elgin, became the second viceroy 
(r. 1862–63). The British policy of alliances with the aristocracy had 
not completely pacified the population. Muslims chaffing at their treat-
ment in the wake of the Sepoy Rebellion revolted in Punjab and in 
the frontier areas. The insurrection was an offshoot of the movement 
founded by followers of Islamic reformer Shah Waliullah, primarily his 
son and spiritual heir Shah Abdul Aziz Muhaddith Dehlavi, and Sayyid 
Ahmad Barelwi. Though Sayyid Barelwi and many of the leaders had 
been killed at the Battle of Balakat in 1831, the movement lived on, 
inspiring a new generation of Islamic holy warriors willing to battle the 
British. The unrest in the frontier lasted from 1858 to 1863, requiring 
four British expeditions—a total of 27,000 troops—to finally suppress 
the uprising.

Sir John Lawrence
After the reign of Lord Elgin, a pair of provisional viceroys were appointed 
in succession before Sir John Laird Mair Lawrence (r. 1864–69) was 

122

named viceroy. He had been the chief commissioner in Punjab following 
the 1857 revolt. Lawrence continued to improve the infrastructure sys-
tem initiated by Lord Dalhousie in the 1850s, including large construc-
tion projects to expand the railway and irrigation systems. Concern for 
public health led him to upgrade sanitation systems and water supplies. 
The Punjab and Oudh Tenancy Act was passed in 1868, which gave ten-
ants ownership of lands they had lived on and cultivated for a requisite 
period of time. Yet with the many changes the British had wrought in the 
agricultural system, the subcontinent had still not recovered its ability 
to feed all its people. In 1866–67 a famine occurred in Orissa, the first 
in a series of famines over the next few decades. Sir Lawrence proposed 
supplying grain to those affected, but his council rejected the proposal 
on the grounds it would interfere with the laws of supply and demand. 
Moreover, council members felt it would be demeaning to offer charity 
to the population. Thus nothing was done, and almost one-quarter of 
Orissa’s population starved. When a famine later occurred in Rajputana, 
Lawrence ignored his council’s opinion and mounted a relief effort, 
which was credited with saving many lives.

Afghanistan still cast a large shadow over the area that is now 
Pakistan, even as British interest in this area grew. In 1863 Dost 
Mohammad Khan (b. 1793) had died, and Sher Ali Khan (1825–79), 
one of his sons, emerged as the ruler after defeating his brother; how-
ever, his brothers continued trying to wrest leadership from him. Sher 
Ali asked Lawrence for help in securing the throne, but as the British 
had a policy of noninterference in the succession battle, he declined. 
Sher Ali was ousted in 1866, but regained control of Afghanistan in 
1868, which he held to his death in 1879. Throughout the reign his 
hold on the throne was tenuous, and the memory of Britain’s lack of 
support remained with him.

Lord Mayo
Sir John Lawrence was succeeded by Richard Southwell Bourke, 
sixth earl of Mayo (r. 1869–72). A major policy change he initiated 
transferred more control over finances to regional authorities, shift-
ing decisionmaking to the provinces. At the regional level, budgetary 
needs could be more accurately gauged and spending more carefully 
monitored. Lord Mayo also initiated large public work programs for 
the construction of roads, railways, canals, and sanitation projects. The 
rails were becoming a key part of the subcontinent’s landscape, draw-
ing together the disparate regions. By 1870 rails connected Multan

with Calcutta and Bombay. Railways played a key part in territorial 
dominance as well, allowing for the quick movement of military assets 
over large distances. When Russia, which was conquering territories to 
the north, built a rail link to the Oxus River, on Afghanistan’s border, 
Britain responded by building a rail link to its frontier on the border 

SIR SAYYID AHMAD KHAN

Regarded as one of the fathers of Pakistan, Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan 
(1817–98) was one of the fi rst to push for Muslim education and 

representation. After the Sepoy Rebellion he wrote forcefully on its 
causes, blaming British inability to understand Indian thinking for the 
violence. A visit to England convinced him the only path toward prog-
ress for Muslims in India lay in Western education. He believed accom-
modation with the British was in Muslims’ best interests. Many Muslims 

were reluctant to have their 
sons educated at schools 
without Islamic teaching, 
and the subsequent lack of 
education kept many from 
pursuing career paths that 
provided opportunity for 
advancement. Ahmad Khan 
believed Western education 
was compatible with Islamic 
teachings. He was the driv-
ing force behind the cre-
ation of the Muhammadan 
Anglo-Oriental (M.A.O.) 
College (later renamed 
Aligarh Muslim University), 
founded in 1875 in Aligarh in 
northern India. Khan made 
Arabic language and Islamic 
studies compulsory courses 

Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan was one of the fi rst at M.A.O. The university 
to call for separate representation for the fomented the thinking and 
subcontinent’s Muslims and Hindus in institu- shaped the minds of future 
tions of self-governance. (Courtesy Pakistan leaders who would father

with Afghanistan. This further opened what is now Pakistan to British 
incursion and domination. After the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, 
Karachi became Europe’s closest Asian port, and sea trade increased in 
volume and importance.

In 1869, his first year in office, Lord Mayo traveled to Ambala in 
North India to meet with Sher Ali Khan, with whom relations had 
been strained since Britain’s failure to help Sher secure the throne in 
Afghanistan. The earl also improved relations between Indian princes 
and the government. However, his efforts to impose an income tax, 
instituted in 1869, drew widespread opposition, and the tax was ulti-
mately unsuccessful in generating projected revenues. He established 
the Department of Agriculture to boost agricultural production. And 
during his tenure Chiefs’ Colleges, created to offer Western education 
to the sons of princes and chiefs, were founded in Lahore, Rajkot (in the 
present-day state of Gujarat in western India), and Ajmer (in modern-
day Rajasthan state in northwest India). Lord Mayo also helped lay the 
groundwork for the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental (M.A.O.) College, 
founded in Aligarh in 1875, shortly after his time as viceroy came to a 
premature end. The college, later renamed Aligarh Muslim University, 
was founded by Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817–98), a leading Muslim 
reformer who believed that access to Western education was essential 
for Muslim progress in British India.

Lord Mayo also initiated prison administration reforms during his 
tenure. Paradoxically, he was stabbed and killed by a Pashtun pris-
oner—a Muslim—at the prison colony in the Andaman Islands in 
1872. The British incorrectly believed Muslims were bound by religion 
to resist British rule, and incidents such as this assassination reinforced 
this view.

Lord Northbrook
Two provisional viceroys succeeded Lord Mayo before Thomas George 
Baring, second baron Northbrook (r. 1872–76) was appointed viceroy. 
In the 1870s Baluchistan remained restive, with tribes throughout the 
area staging border raids on Punjab and Sind. During the previous 
decade, as part of their efforts to work with local rulers in the wake of 
the revolt of 1857, the British had encouraged the new khan of Kalat, 
Khodada Khan (r. 1857–63, 1864–93), then a teenager, to consider 
himself an absolute monarch. The British created a standing army for 
the young khan and with their blessing he had spent the intervening 
years in a failed attempt to establish his dominance over the tribes of 

125

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Baluchistan. With Khodada Khan unable to control them, the British 
had then dispatched their agent Sir Robert Groves Sandeman (1835–
92) to negotiate with tribal leaders, paying the tribes to act as border 
guards. These payoffs reduced, but did not eliminate, raids, which con-
tinued to vex border villages. The British had finally ceded the respon-
sibility, again, to Khodada Khan, treating him as the ruler of the tribal 
lands and providing money to pay tribal leaders to cease their attacks. 
In a further effort to promote law and order, the frontier and other tribal 
areas in the region had been brought under jurisdiction of the Frontier 
Crimes Regulations in 1871. The laws it codified were different from 
those in force in the rest of the subcontinent; they included the stipula-
tion that internal disputes would be settled by jirgas, or tribal councils 
of elders, while ceding British administrators ultimate authority over all 
matters. In 1876 Sandeman received a concession from Khodada Kahn 
to establish a frontier trading post at Quetta, a location that would give 
the British another access point to Afghanistan and control of the Bolan 
Pass. The khan also gave the British permission to post a resident in 
Kabul. Lord Northbrook unsuccessfully objected to the posting, assert-
ing it would subject England to the risk of another war in Afghanistan, 
a conflict he believed would be both costly and unnecessary.

Lord Northbrook staunchly supported the development of busi-
ness and commerce in the subcontinent. He abolished the unpopular 
income tax imposed under Lord Mayo and also sought to protect 
India’s nascent textile industry. The British were intent on wringing 
as much revenue as possible from India. Under the banner of free 
trade, British manufacturers, who had the benefit of industrial produc-
tion, flooded India with cheap imports. Lord Northbrook felt British 
goods brought into the colony should have a higher import duty to 
protect Indian manufacturers and in 1875 made his views known to 
Parliament. However, a conservative government had been elected in 
England during his tenure, and instead of raising Indian import duties 
on British textiles, Parliament reduced the duties to make them more 
competitive with locally produced goods. His policy differences with 
the government too profound to bridge, Lord Northbrook resigned in 
protest in 1876.

Lord Lytton
Lord Northbrook was replaced by Robert Bulwer-Lytton, second baron 
Lytton (r. 1876–80), who set about undoing the reforms Northbrook 
instituted. Lord Lytton tried to restore the authority of the feudal princes

THE RAJ ERA

who had been most disaffected by the previous viceroy’s reforms. His 
primary goal, however, was to regain British control over India and 
avoid the possibility of losing the colony entirely. In 1877 Lord Lytton 
convened a great durbar at Delhi to impress local aristocrats. The guests 
were required to pledge an oath of loyalty in return for the award of 
honors and multigun salutes. During the gathering Queen Victoria was 
proclaimed empress of India.

In response to a famine that began in 1876 and that had by 1877 
claimed the lives of tens of thousands, Lord Lytton established the 
Famine Commission, which recommended building roads and railways 
for shipment of grain to famine-plagued areas and instituting updated 
irrigation methods. Though the subcontinent would experience sub-
sequent famines in 1896 and 1899, the adoption of the commission’s 
recommendations was credited with minimizing the severity of these 
later crises.

Meanwhile, discontent was growing in British-ruled areas. More 
opportunities in the civil service and other reforms had been promised 
to Indians in the Charter of 1833, the Queen’s Proclamation of 1858, 
and other laws. But Lytton sought to renege on these pledges in an 
effort to maintain Britain’s hold on power. The British made a cosmetic 
attempt to placate locals by creating a separate statutory civil service, as 
opposed to the covenanted civil service, in 1879. It included one-sixth 
of the minor posts from the covenanted civil service. Appointments 
were made based on education and social position. This essentially 
closed the ranks to all but loyal members of the aristocracy. So rather 
than quell protests, the new civil service further inflamed educated 
Indians.

Discriminatory taxes and import and export duties angered the busi-
ness class, and the British felt they needed to take steps to forestall 
unrest. The Vernacular Press Act of 1878 reduced freedom of expres-
sion in newspapers printed in non-English languages, effectively sti-
fling reporting of news that put British actions in a negative light. The 
same year the Arms Act forbade Indians from carrying arms without a 
license. Both laws aroused further resentment and anger throughout 
the subcontinent.

Throughout the viceroyships of Lawrence, Mayo, and Northbrook, 
the area of present-day Pakistan had received less attention than other 
regions of the subcontinent. That changed under Lord Lytton, who sup-
ported the “forward policy,” a strategy of containing Russia’s expansion 
toward Afghanistan; the policy’s most notable proponent was British 
prime minister Benjamin Disraeli (r. 1868, 1874–80). The treaties

struck by Sir Sandeman in 1876 with Khodadad Khan gave the British 
a foothold for their military by permitting their annexation of Quetta 
and its surrounding territory. By this time the khan viewed the British 
as the ultimate arbiters of his disputes, as stipulated by treaty.

The Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–1880)
The ruler of Afghanistan, Sher Ali Kahn, continued his weak hold 
on power. Despite Lord Mayo’s visit in 1869, the British still refused 
to support him militarily or financially, and Sher Ali resisted British 
efforts to post an envoy in Kabul. Russia, meanwhile, made overtures 
of assistance to Sher Ali, although he had also refused Russia’s request 
to post an envoy. Concerned about his developing relationship with 
Russia, Lytton dispatched a British officer to meet with the Afghan 
ruler, but Sher Ali refused to grant the emissary an audience and threat-
ened to turn back any British diplomatic mission. In response, Lytton 
declared war on Afghanistan. Three forces consisting of 35,000 troops 
and camp followers under the command of Major General Frederick 
Roberts (1832–1914), General Samuel Browne (1824–1901), and 
General Donald Martin Stewart (1824–1900) advanced on Afghanistan. 
Traversing what is now Pakistan, the British army made a show of force 
that implicitly demonstrated their control over the area. Sher Ali fled 
to Turkestan, from where he dispatched a letter agreeing to allow a 
British envoy in Kabul. Despite his acquiescence, the British occupied 
Kandahar and Jalalabad. On his way back to Afghanistan, Sher Ali 
died. The British struck a treaty with his son, Yaqub Khan (r. 1879), at 
Gandamak, a village in southeast Afghanistan, in 1879.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Gandamak, the British were 
allowed to place a British resident in Kabul and British agents in Herat 
and Kandahar. In return, Yaqub Khan received a subsidy of six lakhs 
(600,000) of rupees a year. Parts of Afghanistan and the whole of the 
Khyber Pass were ceded to Britain. Yaqub Khan also agreed to accept 
British counsel in conducting his foreign policy. But many Afghans 
wanted no British presence in their capital, and in 1879 mutinous troops 
stormed the house of the British Resident, Sir Pierre Louis Cavagnari 
(1841–79), and killed him and his staff. Lord Lytton dispatched an 
army under the command of generals Roberts and Stewart. Another 
of Sher Ali’s sons, Ayub Khan (1857–1914), engaged the British army 
at the Battle of Maiwand in southern Afghanistan in July 1880. The 
largest battle of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, it ended in a British 
defeat, though the Afghan forces also lost many soldiers. Ayub Khan’s

remaining forces next laid siege to Kandahar, where a British resident 
was stationed. General Roberts hurried to relieve Kandahar, marching 
his forces more than 300 miles from Kabul. The British defeated the 
Afghans at the Battle of Kandahar in September 1880, the last major 
conflict of the Second Anglo-Afghan War. During the conflict, without 
the draft animals the British appropriated for the campaign, agriculture 
in the Punjab region suffered, costing the government a fortune in lost 
revenue. Lord Lytton resigned.

Lord Ripon
Following the Second Anglo-Afghan War, Lord Lytton was succeeded 
by George Frederick Samuel Robinson, first marquis of Ripon (r. 1880–
84), a more enlightened viceroy. In the same year British Liberal Party 
leader William Gladstone (r. 1868–74, 1880–85, 1886, 1892–94) was 
beginning the second of his four terms as prime minister of Britain. He 
moderated the “forward policy,” pursuing a less confrontational strategy 
toward Afghanistan. Instead of large settlements and forces, the British 
sought to counter Russian influence by the posting of small forces and 
extensions of existing fortifications. They agreed to recognize as emir of 
Afghanistan Abdur Rahman Khan (r. 1880–1901), a grandson of Dost 
Mohammad, who had long battled Sher Ali, Abdur Rahman’s uncle, for 
the throne. The new emir brought stability to the region and retained 
good relations with the British throughout his reign, which lasted until 
1901. He was succeeded by his son, Habibullah Khan (r. 1901–19).

The Second Anglo-Afghan War brought large areas of Baluchistan 
and the frontier into the British Empire. Yet British objectives in 
Baluchistan were fundamentally different from those in Sind and 
Punjab. In Baluchistan, the British were interested in the military and 
geopolitical value of the land; in the rest of the subcontinent, they 
sought primarily to extract income. But the local populations still bore 
significant costs from the British incursions. British development of 
cantonments, or military quarters, at Quetta and other areas required 
evicting many locals from their lands, creating an army of landless peas-
ants. This action led to the suppression of local tribes and increased 
resentment of the British throughout the subcontinent, particularly 
among Muslims. Indians also had to endure tax increases, levied in 
order to pay for the war.

During his tenure as viceroy, Lord Ripon abolished the Vernacular 
Press Act established by his predecessor, posted Indians in high gov-
ernment posts, broadened the powers of local governments, and made

municipal offices elective positions, giving locals experience in democ-
racy. Laws were passed to safeguard working conditions in factories. 
He encouraged education of the subcontinent’s people, appointing the 
Hunter Education Commission, whose report of 1884, among other 
accomplishments, helped focus attention on the plight of Muslims in 
the subcontinent. The viceroy also attempted the radical step of allow-
ing Indian judges to try Europeans under the Ilbert Bill, enacted by 
the Indian Legislative Council in 1884, but loud European opposition 
forced him to back down.

However, economic exploitation continued throughout Lord Ripon’s 
tenure. In the years following the reduction of import duties on British 
textiles in 1876, economic manipulation of tariffs and trade became 
common. In 1879 all tariff duties for English goods were abolished, 
primarily to help the British fabric industry. In 1895, after the British 
placed an excise duty of 5 percent to raise revenue, Parliament imposed 
a similar excise duty on Indian cotton goods. Foreign exchange between 
the Indian rupee and the British pound was fixed in such a way as to 
stimulate imports of British goods into India and curtail exports from 
the subcontinent.

As Indian demands for autonomy and freedom began to grow, 
Muslims continued their political awakening. Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan 
spoke out forcefully for separate representation for Muslims in self-
governance institutions. He won recognition in 1882 for the principle 
of separate electorates for Muslims on Lord Ripon’s municipal councils. 
In a speech before the Governor-General’s Council in January of 1883, 
Ahmad Khan explained the need for separate representation: “So long 
as differences of race and creed, and the distinctions of caste form an 
important element in the socio-political life in India, and influence her 
inhabitants in matters connected to the administration and welfare of 
the country at large, the system of election, pure and simple, cannot 
be safely adopted. The larger community would totally override the 
interests of the smaller community, and the ignorant public would hold 
Government responsible for introducing measures which might make 
the differences of race and creed more violent than ever” (Symonds 
1950, 30–31).

Lord Dufferin
Liberalization of policies that began under Lord Ripon continued 
under Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, the earl of Dufferin (r. 
1884–88, later first marquis of Dufferin and Ava), his successor. The

THE RAJ ERA

Bengal Tenancy Bill, proposed during Lord Ripon’s viceroyalty, passed 
in Bengal in 1885 under Lord Dufferin’s stewardship. The law defined 
and improved the rights of farmers under their landlords. Working 
conditions and exploitation of the subcontinent’s labor force had come 
to the attention of the British public, which had already grappled with 
similar homegrown abuses springing from its industrial revolution. In 
response, Parliament passed the Factor Act, which limited the number 
of hours employees could be required to work, and forbade children 
under age nine from employment in factories.

In 1886 Lord Dufferin appointed a commission to explore ways to 
expand public services. The viceroy also wrote A Report on the Condition 
of the Lower Classes Population in Bengal, called the Dufferin Report, 
published in 1888, which countered claims that the poor had benefited 
from British rule in the subcontinent. His wife founded a charity fund 
that built Lady Dufferin hospitals for women, staffed by female doc-
tors, which took all patients regardless of ability to pay. Today, Lady 
Dufferin Hospital in Karachi is the largest women’s hospital in Pakistan. 
However, as viceroy Lord Dufferin also sought to ease concerns of the 
British population of India, which viewed the reforms introduced by 
Lord Ripon with unease.

For most Indians, British reforms came too late and did not go far 
enough. In 1885 the Indian National Congress (INC) was founded, 
established by a new generation of Indians educated in Western-style 
educational institutions. Consumed by nationalist zeal, INC members 
met regularly and, though they had no legal authority, passed resolu-
tions recommending actions and policies for the British-run govern-
ment to follow. Several British helped in founding the Congress Party 
(as the INC is otherwise known), viewing the organization as a way to 
monitor the opposition, and as a relief valve for political discontent.

The INC began as a moderate political party, supported by the educated 
middle classes—lawyers, teachers, and journalists—as well as by some 
members of the business community and landed gentry. They sought 
increased British assistance in training and education, not independence. 
But as moderate voices within the INC were ignored by the British, more 
radical leaders gained power. Some Hindu extremists played on anti-
Muslim prejudices, and their incendiary rhetoric went largely unchal-
lenged. Muslims watched mute while shrill INC members who denounced 
British rule were received with cordial respect by the viceroy. Leaders of 
the Muslim community were reluctant to strike a militant stance, since 
the financial well-being of educated professionals and landlords was in the 
hands of the British. But with the establishment of educational institutions

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

such as the M.A.O., a new generation of educated Muslims was com-
ing of age, eager to pursue its own path. After 1884 Ahmad Khan began 
to support Muslim separatism, advising Muslims to boycott the Indian 
National Congress, and in 1886 he formed a rival institution to the INC, 
the Mohammedan Education Conference, a predecessor of the All India 
Muslim League that would form 20 years later. In 1887 a Muslim was 
named president of the INC; Ahmad Khan denounced the appointment. 
He felt the appointment would lead Muslims into what he saw as a false 
belief that they and the Hindu majority could work together and peace-
fully coexist in one nation independent of the British. His opposition to 
the INC coincided with that of the British: As the INC as a whole adopted 
a more independent stance, British support evaporated. However, many 
Muslims continued to support the stance of the INC’s less militant mem-
bers and favored a nonconfrontational approach to their differences with 
the British. Following the fourth annual session of Congress, government 
officials were banned from joining the organization.

Lord Landsdowne and Lord Curzon
Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice, fifth marquis of Lansdowne, 
succeeded Lord Dufferin as viceroy (r. 1888–94). His tenure and that 
of his later successor George Nathaniel Curzon, first marquis Curzon 
of Kedleston (r. 1899–1905), underscored the fact that liberalization 
accorded to the majority of the subcontinent was withheld in the fron-
tier areas of what is today Pakistan. The Indian Councils Act, passed by 
Parliament in 1892, increased membership in the central and provincial 
legislative councils in the Punjab and Sind, but not in Baluchistan or 
the frontier area. These western provinces were deemed too untamed 
to permit such reforms.

Defining the Border
As kingdoms in the region grew and declined, their territories were 
often in flux. The border between Afghanistan and British India had 
never been fixed. That boundary was delineated by the Durand Line, 
created during Lord Lansdowne’s time as viceroy. Sir Henry Mortimer 
Durand (1850–1924) was an officer in the corps when he requested 
permission from Abdur Rahman, the emir of Afghanistan, to determine 
a line of demarcation between Afghanistan and the British Empire. 
Abdur Rahman could not well refuse, as the British controlled trade 
routes in and out of Afghanistan and paid the emir subsidies. When 
completed in 1893, the Durand Line moved the border of the British

THE RAJ ERA

territory from the foothills west to the crests of the highest peaks and 
ridges in the mountains dividing the territories. This brought several 
tribes, including the Afridis, the Mahsuds, the Wazirs, and the Swat, 
under nominal British rule if not control. The British launched several 
military campaigns to subdue the tribes and demonstrate their regional 
dominance. In 1895 an uprising broke out in Chitral and soon spread 
to the rest of the tribal area. During the campaign a force of allied 
tribesmen besieged 400 British troops in the Chitral Fort; they also 
succeeded in closing the Khyber Pass. It took British forces 48 days to 
come to their countrymen’s rescue and relieve the siege.

In the early 1890s the chesslike maneuvering the British and Russians 
engaged in as each attempted to gain power and influence in the area 
became known as the Great Game. The Pamir Mountains, which extend 
from the Hindu Kush into Afghanistan, took center stage in their 
contest. The Great Game came to an end with the Pamir Boundary 
Agreement of March 1895, signed by Russia and Great Britain. It estab-
lished the Wakhan Corridor, a narrow sliver of Afghanistan in the Pamir 
Mountains, as a buffer between Russia (now Tajikistan) and British-held 
India in what is today Pakistan. The corridor, about 300 miles (480 km) 
long and less than 10 (16 km) miles wide in some places, borders China 
on the east. In 1896 the border between the British and Persian territory 
of Baluchistan was established.

Lord Curzon, who became viceroy in 1899, took a different tack 
in dealing with the rebellious tribes. He saw the frontier Pashtun as a 
unique population, independent and strong willed, whose heritage fell 
far outside of social norms not only in Britain but even in this corner 
of the subcontinent. He recognized that raiding and plundering, the 
basis of their livelihood, had long been the only means of survival in 
the frontier. In 1900 Curzon established the area as the North-West 
Frontier Province, placing it under the direction of a seasoned chief 
commissioner.

Cultured and well traveled, Curzon instituted numerous reforms. 
He emphasized improvements in university education, overhauled the 
police department, bolstered farmers’ rights, and pushed credit societ-
ies and agricultural banks to give financial assistance to the poor. Under 
his direction thousands of miles of railway were built.

An Agrarian Revolution
In the last quarter of the 19th century agrarian reforms and improve-
ments to the infrastructure introduced by the British showed some 
results. Before this time, much of the Indus Valley was dry and sparsely

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

inhabited. A canal system the Mughals built to irrigate the area had 
fallen into disrepair. Changes in the course and flow of the Indus had 
added to depopulation. The British undertook large-scale projects to 
repair and expand the ancient canal system and engineered massive 
additional irrigation systems that made vast areas of formerly uninhab-
ited lands in Punjab arable. An expanding railway system transported 
grain from Punjab for shipment to England. After 1879 Lahore and 
Karachi were linked by rail. By 1883 it was possible to travel from 
Karachi to the Khyber Pass by rail. During construction of the Lahore-
Multan track, engineers discovered the lost city of Harappa. They 
used the ancient brick they found to build 100 miles (160 km) of the 
railway’s embankment. Curzon recognized the region’s archaeological 
importance. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, passed during 
his tenure, made the government responsible for maintaining historic 
buildings and investigating archaeological sites. Taxila and cities of the 
long-lost Indus Valley Civilization were first excavated as a result of 
this act.

From the 1880s onward peasants settled on these newly fertile lands. 
This set in motion a new political dynamic in the region as agrarian 
landlords came to accumulate land and power. Peasants were limited 
to plots of 100 to 150 acres, with landlords receiving a percentage of 
crops in rent. Sometimes the rents were usurious, and tenant farmers 
often fell into debt, their plots seized by the landlords. Other peasants 
lost their lands to moneylenders. By the late 19th century some of these 
holdings became mini–feudal states and their owners strong support-
ers of the British, whose policies served their interests. The situation 
was antagonizing many Muslims, who comprised a majority of sepoys 
in Punjab. To help address the problem of small farmers having their 
lands repossessed and stem the unrest it was stirring, Parliament passed 
the Punjab Land Alienation Act in 1900. The act defined tribes as either 
agricultural or nonagricultural and forbade nonagricultural tribes from 
acquiring the land of agricultural debtors.

Partition of Bengal
Despite the fact that it was the region first exposed to the British pres-
ence—or because of it—Bengal, the northeast corner of the subconti-
nent, lying east of the Ganges, remained backward and undeveloped. 
The eastern portion of Bengal was predominantly Muslim, the western 
portion Hindu. The religious dichotomy had complicated administra-
tion of Bengal, as did the large population. To break the administrative 
bottleneck, in 1905 Lord Curzon partitioned Bengal into two parts:

West Bengal encompassed Bihar and Orissa, with Calcutta as its capi-
tal, and East Bengal incorporated the province of Assam, with Dacca 
(modern-day Dhaka) as its capital. From the start, Hindus objected to

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

the partition, feeling their land was being taken away. The protest was 
more widespread and sustained than anticipated by the British and 
increasingly included Hindu nationalist overtones as well as violence. 
The opposition to the partition also spawned the swadeshi movement, 
which advocated boycotting British goods, a form of protest that turned 
out to be surprisingly effective.

Toward Muslim Independence
As viceroy Lord Curzon enjoyed the customary control over the Indian 
Army’s commander in chief (CIC). But in 1905 the secretary of state 
for India in England changed the policy, taking direct oversight of the 
CIC for himself. Lord Curzon resigned in protest. Gilbert John Elliot-
Murray-Kynynmound, fourth earl of Minto, succeeded Lord Curzon as 
viceroy (r. 1905–10).

Political change, both peaceful and violent, was in the air. Muslim 
aspirations were being expressed in Muslim-majority areas, and the 
concept of self-government for Muslims began to take root. In 1906 
the All India Muslim League was founded, a political party that would 
play a major role in the future of the subcontinent’s Muslims. Formed 
in Dacca (now Dhaka) at the annual meeting of the Muhammadan 
Educational Conference, attended by 3,000 delegates, it was created 
in answer to concerns that Muslims would be oppressed by the Hindu 
majority if the British ever vacated the subcontinent. Sultan Muhammad 
Shah, Aga Khan III (1877–1957), hereditary leader of a large Shia sect, 
was appointed first honorary president. The league’s principles were 
spelled out in its Green Book, though its goals did not initially include a 
separate state for the subcontinent’s Muslims. Instead of independence, 
the group’s principles stressed the protection of Muslim liberties and 
rights, and encouragement of understanding between Muslims and 
other Indians. Indeed, its initial platform included the goal of promot-
ing feelings of loyalty to the British government among Muslims, which 
caused some of the more militant voices in the community to shun 
membership.

Despite the appearance of liberalization, heavy-handed British poli-
cies had fed rising tension and opposition throughout the subconti-
nent. Attempts to placate the population by providing the appearance 
of increased local political power were failing. The British hoped to 
mollify the upper classes sufficiently to win their tacit support for con-
tinued British rule. Viceroy Minto worked with the British secretary 
of state for Indian affairs, John Morley, First Viscount Morley (1838–

1923), to develop a framework that would give Indians more direct 
control over their government while keeping the ultimate authority in 
the hands of the British. In 1906 Lord Morley announced the govern-
ment’s intent to cede greater legislative power to local rule. Parliament 
approved the changes as the Government of India Act of 1909, more 
commonly called the Minto-Morley Reforms. The reforms would be a 
landmark in the subcontinent’s constitutional history and begin a new 
chapter in its march to independence.

THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE 

(1909–1947)

During the last half of the Raj, nationalist sentiment and violence 
weakened Britain’s grip on the subcontinent, the crown jewel of 

its global empire. Calls for a separate nation for Muslims on the pre-
dominantly Hindu subcontinent began to be heard alongside growing 
demands for an independent India.

As British power ebbed, more control was ceded to local popula-
tions. The Hindu majority’s voice was amplified by Muslim reticence 
to engage in the political process. The British supported the concept of 
legal assurances for the recognition of Muslim rights in the overwhelm-
ingly Hindu subcontinent. Through the All India Muslim League and 
the Indian National Congress, or Congress Party, efforts to reconcile 
Muslim and Hindu political aspirations were repeatedly made, but all 
ended in failure. With the inability of Indian and British institutions 
to protect the rights of the Muslim minority, many politically active 
Muslims saw a divided subcontinent with a separate nation for Muslims 
as the only way for them to achieve equality. As Britain prepared to cede 
independence to the subcontinent, the political battle between Muslim 
and Hindu led to growing sectarian strife. The monumental struggle 
for Muslim rights saw its conclusion in the creation of the Republic of 
Pakistan in 1947.

The Government of India Act of 1909 
(Minto-Morley Reforms)
The Government of India Act of 1909—also called the Minto-Morley 
Reforms for its sponsors, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound (1845–
1914), fourth earl of Minto, viceroy of India, and John Morley (1838–
1923), Viscount Morley, secretary of state for Indian affairs—was

THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE

aimed at answering growing Indian demands for self-government. Its 
sponsors intended it to provide cosmetic changes to British rule rather 
than any real power sharing. Yet it was noteworthy in that the British 
had previously ignored popular aspiration in formulating governmental 
policy. The reforms mandated that legislative councils be established 
in all provinces and that their members be elected by the population 
each represented. However, the councils had only advisory power. 
Membership in the Viceroy’s Legislative Council was increased from 
25 to 60. Additionally, Indians were to be appointed to the Viceroy’s 
Executive Councils and the Secretary of State’s Council and were to 
take over the governorships of Bombay and Madras. Minority groups, 
including Muslims, Sikhs, landowners, and the tea and jute industry, 
would have their own representation in provincial legislative councils. 
This encouraged more Muslim participation in politics. Many Hindus 
viewed the changes as proof the British had become pro-Muslim.

Partition of Bengal Annulled
At the beginning of the 20th century Muslims were considered politi-
cally pro-British, as British support for Muslims’ basic rights countered 
the Hindu nationalist stance of many Hindu politicians. Since its forma-
tion in 1906, the All India Muslim League reflected that pro-British bias 
in its moderate voice. However, British policies after the first decade of 
the century led to a gradual hardening of the Muslim position. The 1905 
partition of Bengal had led to sustained political protests by Hindus, 
which increasingly included violence and acts of terrorism against 
the British. In December 1911 Britain’s king George V (r. 1910–36) 
unexpectedly annulled the partition, caving in, as Muslims saw it, to 
“bombs and bullets” (Stephens 1967, 72). Muslims were shocked and 
angry. Besides being a betrayal of the Muslims, the reversal cast doubt 
on all the British stood for. From the day of partition, the decision was 
portrayed as irreversible, as permanent as the empire itself.

“We told the Mussalmans that the partition was a settled fact, over 
and over again; there could have been scarcely a civil servant who had 
not declared that it would be impossible for the British Government to 
reverse the decision,” Lord Minto remarked in the House of Lords in 
1912 after his return (Stephens 1967, 72). If British steadfastness over 
so important an issue could be suddenly reversed, what of its insistence 
on the limits of independence?

In addition to the annulment of Bengali partition, other British 
actions contributed to the increasing resistance among Muslims. A

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

 turning point came in 1913 when the British destroyed part of a mosque 
in Kanpur, in north central India, to facilitate road construction. 
Muslims gathered to protest, and security forces opened fire.

Many of the young Muslims educated at the Muhammadan Anglo-
Oriental (M.A.O.) College (now Aligarh Muslim University) and similar 
institutions had previously avoided joining the Muslim League, prefer-
ring to identify themselves with political aspirations for the subconti-
nent as a whole, rather than for Muslims as a separate group. However, 
this now began to change. Among the new members who joined in 1913 
were Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876–1948), an English-trained lawyer 
and member of the Indian National Congress, and Maulana Abul Kalam 
Azad (1888–1958), also a member of Congress noted for his revolution-
ary zeal. These new leaders not only hardened the league’s stance against 
the British but advocated greater cooperation with Hindus through the 
Congress Party as well. In 1913 the league changed its platform from 
support for British rule to the goal of self-government for the subconti-
nent. The growing militancy alienated some moderate members of the 
league. Aga Khan III, Sultan Muhammad Shah (1877–1957), the first 
president of the league, resigned in 1914 because of his discomfort with 
its growing anti-British attitude. Jinnah was elected the league’s presi-

dent in 1916 and would go on to 
play the principal role in the cre-
ation of an independent Pakistan. 
He is popularly known in Pakistan 
as Quaid-e-Azam, or Great 
Leader, and is considered to be 
the father of the nation.

Lucknow Pact
Hindus were also chaffing under 
British rule, and the mutual 
opposition drove the two reli-
gious groups together. Reflecting 
the growing solidarity between 
the Muslim League and Congress 
Party, in December 1915 both 
organizations held their annual

end British rule of the subcontinent. In October 1916, a group of 19 
Muslim and Hindu elected members of the Imperial Legislative Council 
sent the viceroy a reform memorandum. The British ignored the memo-
randum, but it became the basis for an agreement on electorates and rep-
resentation reached by Congress and Muslim League leaders at Calcutta 
in November 1916 and ratified at Lucknow in December. Called the 
Lucknow Pact, the agreement established an alliance between the Muslim 
League and the Indian National Congress. It mandated self-government 
in India with separate electorates for Hindus and Muslims, and it guar-
anteed a minimum number of representatives to adherents in areas where 
they were a minority. Muslims were to have one-third representation in 
the central government. The Muslim League dropped its claim to major-
ity status in Punjab and Bengal in exchange for the promise of extra seats 
in the Muslim minority areas. The spirit of cooperation was relatively 
short-lived, but it marked the first time Congress recognized the Muslim 
League as a legitimate representation of the Muslim community.

Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms
During World War I (1914–18), which pitted the Allied forces (Great 
Britain, the United States, Russia, and France, among others) against 
the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary, joined by others, 
including the Ottoman Empire), Indians of all backgrounds supported 
Great Britain. In August 1917 Britain had promised the subcontinent 
a transition to self-governance in recognition of its people’s contribu-
tion to the war effort. Keeping that pledge seemed a necessity: At the 
war’s end the Defense of India Act would expire, and conscripts from 
the subcontinent, combat tested and out of work, would return home. 
Retaining control of the subcontinent might not be possible.

In 1918, following six months in India, Edwin Samuel Montagu 
(1879–1924), secretary of state for Indian affairs (1917–22), unveiled 
his constitutional reform plans, drafted with the viceroy, Frederic John 
Napier Thesiger, third baron Chelmsford (r. 1916–21). Parliament 
approved them as part of the Government of India Act of 1919, com-
monly known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. They introduced 
diarchy, a system of double government for the provinces of British 
India. This marked the first appearance of democratic principles in the 
executive branch. In coming years the democratic principles would be 
expanded until the subcontinent ultimately achieved independence. But 
these first reforms were limited. Both the Muslim League and Congress 
initially favored the constitutional reforms the British promised.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

However, at the same time, efforts at repression continued. In 
February 1919 the British passed the Rowlatt Acts, named for Sydney 
Rowlatt, an English judge who chaired the investigative commission 
on seditious activities, which allowed preventive detention without 
charges or trial.

The Khilafat Movement
Although many leading Muslims supported Great Britain during the 
war, some backed the Ottoman Empire, the last vestige of the Islamic 
Empire that had begun with the conquests of the prophet Muhammed 
(ca. 570–632) in Arabia some 1,300 years before. The Islamic Empire 
once reached from Spain and North Africa to China. During the Muslim 
Mughal Empire, Muslims of India ignored the Ottoman Empire’s claim 
to leadership of the Islamic community. (Tipu Sultan was the first 
Indian Muslim ruler who, having been frustrated in his attempts to 
gain recognition from the Mughals, had turned to the sultan of Turkey 
to establish a legal right to his throne.) But the Muslims of India now 
had no political power. The Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI (r. 1918–22), 
whose office had long laid claim to leadership of the world’s Muslims, 
now appeared to them as a suitable caliph. Though the caliphate bore 
little connection with its historical antecedents—particularly since the 
Young Turks, a political movement that eschewed Islamic ties, had 
moved the Ottoman Empire in a more Western, secular direction—the 
office nonetheless represented the only Muslim political power in 
the world. Some among India’s Muslims supported Germany as well, 
because Germany was allied with the Ottoman Empire. Paradoxically, 
many of the troops from the subcontinent who joined the war effort on 
behalf of Britain were Muslims from the present-day Pakistan area.

As the end of World War I approached, the dissolution of the 
Ottoman Empire became imminent. Muslims of South Asia mounted 
an effort to save the empire, joining in the Khilafat movement. They 
sought preservation of the caliphate and protested the Allied treatment 
of the Ottoman Empire. In December 1918 the Muslim League passed 
a resolution to work for the preservation of the caliphate. Support was 
not unanimous. Jinnah and the raja of Mahmudabad (r. 1914–73), 
another influential leader, opposed involvement in international affairs, 
as Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan had done earlier. Nonetheless, the emotional 
appeal was unstoppable. The anti-British sentiments of the Khilafat 
movement overlapped with the interests of the wider Indian nationalist 
movement, and, when the Rowlatt Acts were passed in February 1919,

they sparked widespread protest throughout India. On April 10, 1919, 
riots erupted in Amritsar in Punjab. In response, a ban was imposed on 
public meetings. Unaware of the new edict, demonstrators gathered at 
the Jallianwala Bagh gardens in Amritsar on April 13, 1919. The British 
opened fire on the crowd, resulting in 379 dead and 1,200 wounded, 
according to official tallies, though other accounts put the number 
of casualties considerably higher. The incident became known as the 
Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, or Tragedy. Unrest spread to other cities in 
Punjab, where martial law was declared from mid-April to early June. 
The law was enforced with public beatings and humiliations.

Leaders of the Khilafat movement and the Congress Party issued a 
joint statement in 1920 calling for a boycott of British goods, schools, 
and institutions. This noncooperation movement was led by Mohandas 
K. Gandhi (1869–1947), who emerged as the leader of the Indian nation-
alist movement around this time. Gandhi supported the Khilafat move-
ment as a way to bring Muslims and Hindus together in the movement 
for independence. Jinnah and other Western-educated Muslims, on the 
other hand, feared that a religious focus would ultimately divide Muslims 
and Hindus. He favored a secular political leadership, called the move-
ment unconstitutional, and resigned from the Congress Party in protest.

Despite the movement and threats of noncooperation against the 
British, the Ottoman Empire disappeared with the signing of the Treaty 
of Sèvres in 1920. Yet the Khilafat movement remained alive for more 
than a decade, finding resonance in Punjab, Baluchistan, and Sind. It 
ended when the sultan, the figurehead of a much-reduced Turkey, was 
removed in 1922, and the Turkish government itself abolished the 
caliphate the same year.

The collapse of efforts to save the Ottoman Empire spawned the ill-fated 
Hijrat, or emigration, movement. Since the British failed to support the 
caliphate, Islamic scholars concluded that it was sinful to live in British-
ruled territory. Hundreds of ulama, or religious leaders, signed a fatwa 
urging Muslims to immigrate to Islamic lands. In August 1922 thousands 
of Muslims abandoned their homes and possessions and began trekking 
to Afghanistan. Most were Pashtuns from the frontier area, Baluchis, and 
Sindis. Afghanistan, bowing to British pressure, closed its border, leaving 
the would-be émigrés homeless and destitute.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

of power to the downtrodden gave tribal elements in the frontier areas 
an ideological basis for resisting colonialism and expelling the British. 
Habibullah Khan, the emir of Afghanistan (r. 1901–19), was assassinated 
in 1919, and rule passed to his son, Amanullah Khan (r. 1919–29). While 
Punjab was under martial law, Amanullah declared war on Britain, which 
he believed was responsible for his father’s death. The Afghan army began 
marching toward its border with India. Frontier tribes rose against the 
British, and Indian troops mutinied, deserted, and looted. The Afghan 
army reached Punjab before being driven back by stiff British resistance. 
However, the light British forces were not a great offensive threat, incapa-
ble of carrying a war to Afghanistan, despite their threats to the contrary. 
The Third Afghan War ended with an armistice treaty, the Rawalpindi 
Agreement, signed in August 1919. The agreement reconfirmed the 
Durand Line as the border between Afghanistan and British India and 
recognized Afghanistan’s right to noninterference within its borders.

The entire NWFP area had been left out of the reforms of 1892 and 
1909, as had Baluchistan. With disorder spreading through the tribal 
areas, the British continued denying self-rule to the border region, 
despite a commission finding in 1922 that self-rule might help quell 
the unrest. The British found other ways to consolidate control over 
the tribal areas: More roads were built; a railroad now ran through 
the Khyber Pass; and the routes were increasingly traveled by military 
convoys, as local militias charged with protecting British interests were 
replaced by professional soldiers under direct British command.

In March 1927 Jinnah convened a meeting in Delhi with some 30 of 
the subcontinent’s Muslim leaders in an effort to close the gap between 
Hindu and Muslim aspirations. At the meeting’s conclusion the leaders 
unanimously agreed to relinquish the demand for a separate elector-
ate for India’s Muslims if the Hindu leadership accepted what became 
known as the Delhi Proposals. These four proposals were that Muslims 
in Punjab and Bengal have representation in the legislative council in 
proportion to their population; that one-third of the seats in the Central 
Legislature be reserved for Muslims; that Sind be made a separate 
province; and that government reforms adopted in the subcontinent be 
extended to NWFP and Baluchistan. It was the first and only time the 
leadership of the Muslim League agreed to joint electorates.

Simon Commission and the Nehru Report
The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms had stipulated the formation of 
a commission to study the results of the reforms at the end of 10

years. The commission would then recommend the next steps toward 
the subcontinent’s self-rule. An all-British delegation, the Simon 
Commission (named for its director, British statesman John Allesbrook 
Simon; 1873–1954) was appointed in 1927. It was widely seen as a self-
serving effort by the British to avoid meaningful change. No Indians 
were appointed to the commission. As a result many political parties 
refused to participate in the commission’s work. In 1927 the Muslim 
League split into two factions, the Jinnah League and the Shafi League, 
over the issue. The organization’s president, Mian Muhammad Shafi
(1869–1932) favored cooperation with the British, while Jinnah and his 
allies and other Muslim organizations supported a boycott. The arriv-
ing British delegation was met with protests. Almost all major political 
parties boycotted the commission’s hearings, and its mission ended in 
failure. At the end of 1927 Congress Party adopted complete indepen-
dence from Britain as its objective.

With the Simon Commission failing to come up with a workable 
political reform plan, the British turned the problem over to local political 
leaders. In February 1928 some 100 representatives of Muslim political 
organizations and Congress met at the All Parties Conference to draft a 
constitution. As usual a resolution of the differences between Muslim 
and Hindu leaders was beyond reach. Minority rights—separate politi-
cal representation for minority communities—was the primary issue 
of contention, with Muslims in support and Hindus, who controlled 
Congress, opposed. In March the second meeting of the All Parties 
Conference was held, with the same lack of progress. At the third All 
Parties Conference, in Bombay in May 1928, delegates appointed a 
small committee headed by Motilal Nehru (1861–1931) to draft a con-
stitution. Two Muslims were on the nine-person committee.

After three months, the committee issued the Nehru Report. It rec-
ommended abolishing separate electorates, eliminating any weightage 
given to minority communities and populations and making Hindi the 
national language. It further called for reducing Muslim representation 
in the Central Assembly (from one-third to one-quarter) and rejected 
the recent acceptance by Congress of the Delhi Proposals. Muslims 
refused to accept the report, and an attempt to find a compromise solu-
tion failed. Despite pleas from Jinnah, Congress ultimately adopted 
the report and threatened the British government with a disobedience 
movement if the terms were not implemented into law by December 
31, 1929.

The Nehru Report reunited the Jinnah and Shafi wings of the Muslim 
League, divided since 1924, as they took a common stand against the

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

proposals. In early 1929, the All Parties Muslim Conference convened 
in Delhi under Aga Khan to counter the report with Muslim demands. 
The conference was a turning point in Muslim political attitudes and 
expression. Jinnah, who had championed cooperation with the Hindus, 
announced his split with Hindus and Congress.

In March 1929 Jinnah articulated an alternative course in a set of 
tenets that became known as the Fourteen Points. Most of the prin-
ciples had already been advanced. The points stated that the govern-
ment should be federal, with provinces exercising residuary powers. 
They called for all legislatures in the country and other elected bodies 
to be constituted on the principle of adequate minority representation 
without reducing the majority in any province to a minority or even 
equality. These precepts became a blueprint for Muslim political aspira-
tions for most of the next decade. The Muslim League made inclusion 
of the demands expressed in the Fourteen Points a prerequisite for their 
agreement to any constitution.

A final effort by Jinnah to end the deadlock with the Hindus over the 
Nehru Report, made at the All Parties Convention at Calcutta in 1929, 
failed. As the new decade dawned, the divide among Muslims, Hindus, 
and the British was sharp and deep. At its annual meeting in 1930 in 
Lahore, Congress demanded Britain make a pledge that the subconti-
nent would receive dominion status (a self-governing nation with the 
British Commonwealth), like Canada and Australia, as a prerequisite 
for participating in discussions with the Simon Commission. Britain’s 
rejection sparked a second noncooperation movement in 1930. The 
Simon Commission released its report early in 1930.

Despite the framework of the Fourteen Points Muslims now clung 
to, some began to doubt any accommodation could ever be reached, 
given Hindu intransigence and British indifference to Muslim demands. 
At a meeting of the All India Muslim League at Allahabad in 1930, its 
president, Allama Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938), a noted poet and phi-
losopher, raised the possibility that peace would be impossible between 
Muslims and Hindus unless Muslims were given the status of a separate 
nation. He stated that the predominantly Muslim northwest region of 
the subcontinent was destined to form a self-governing unit. This was 
the first public call for statehood for the subcontinent’s Muslims.

Badshah Khan and the Khudai Khidmatgar
In the frontier areas the noncooperation movement was led by a 
charismatic Pashtun pacifist, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (1890–1988),

THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE

FOURTEEN POINTS OF 
M. A. JINNAH (1929)

Muslim opposition to the Nehru Report had a galvanizing effect 
 on Muslim unity. At a meeting of the All India Muslim League on 

March 28, 1929, Jinnah proposed an alternative to the Nehru Report 
contained in a series of positions on issues of government and minority 
rights. These became known as his Fourteen Points. They were:

 1.  A federal, rather than a unitary, form of government
 2.  Electoral safeguards for minorities in all provinces
 3.  Equality for each province
 4.  Separate electorates for religious and other groups
 5.  In the Central Legislature, Muslims would have at least 

one-third of the seats.
 6.  No resolution or bill shall be passed in any elected body 

if three-quarters of the members of any community in that 
particular body opposes it.

 7.  Muslim majorities in Punjab, Bengal, and NWFP should not 
be altered by territorial changes or redistributions.

 8.  Sind should be separated from Bombay and be made a 
separate province.

 9.  NWFP and Baluchistan should enjoy the same reforms as 
all other provinces.

 10.  All religions should have full liberty of belief, worship, obser-
vance, association, and education.

11. Muslims should have an adequate share of employment in all 
the services of the state and in local self-governing bodies.

12.  The constitution should guarantee the protection of Muslim 
culture and the protection and promotion of Muslim educa-
tion, language, religion, education, and charitable institutions.

13.  Cabinets at both the central and the provincial level should 
have a proportion of at least one-third Muslim ministers.

14.  Any changes to the constitution by the Central Legislature 
require the consent of all the federating states.

The All India Muslim League made inclusion of the principles con-
tained in these 14 points a requirement for Muslim acceptance of any 
constitution.

called Badshah Khan “king of chiefs,” who founded the Khudai 
Khidmatgar (“servants of God”) organization in the 1920s. A close 
ally of Gandhi, Badshah Khan joined the Congress Party, rather than

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

the Muslim League, which he saw as pro-British. Badshah Khan man-
aged to unite the various Pashtun tribes behind his movement—at 
its peak the organization had 100,000 members—and the Khudai 
Khidmatgar became famous for its pacifist opposition to the British. 
However, the movement provoked violent British efforts at suppres-
sion that affected the entire NWFP. Seeking political partners with 
the power to pressure the British to rein in their aggressive tactics, 
the Khudai Khidmatgar formed an alliance with the Congress Party. 
To counter the Khidmatgars’ influence in the area the Muslim League 
sought supporters from among the wealthy landlords, who opposed 
the Khidmatgars.

Round Table Conferences
The British central-left Labour Party, had traditionally given more sup-
port to the concept of independence for the subcontinent than the 
Conservatives. With the Labour Party’s return to power in Britain in 
1929, prospects for a headway to the independence impasse improved. 
In November 1930 the British convened a Round Table Conference in 
London involving Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians to discuss 
new constitutional reforms. But all Congress Party leaders were in jail 
on charges related to the civil disobedience movement. They passed 
the word that they would boycott any future constitutional discussion 
unless the Nehru Report was enforced in its entirety as the constitution 
of India. Still, 73 delegates attended the conference, including Jinnah. 
The Muslims insisted on keeping weightage and separate electorates, 
while the Hindus wanted to end these electoral processes. The Hindus 
sought a powerful central government, with the Muslims preferring a 
loose federation of autonomous provinces. The Muslim majority sta-
tus in Punjab and Bengal was also a point of contention, with Hindus 
opposing their imposition. The conference ended in January 1931 with 
an agreement to provide safeguards for minorities in the constitution 
under a federal system of rule.

The British government saw the Indian National Congress as the key 
to developing a constitution that would pave the way for independence. 
Muslim-Hindu conflict was not as important to the British as Hindu-
British cooperation. Nonetheless, the British employed a “divide and rule” 
strategy in the subcontinent as they (and other powers throughout his-
tory) had in other lands under their control, stoking regional rivalries and 
undermining efforts of indigenous solidarity to prevent the formation of a

THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE

powerful, unified opposition. The historic animosity between Muslim and 
Hindu made this approach particularly potent and useful in the subcon-
tinent. Under Sir George Cunningham, governor of NWFP (r. 1937–46; 
1947–48), British government agents continuously exhorted the Pashtun 
to avoid conspiring with Hindu revolutionaries. Yet it is noteworthy that 
the population to whom they preached had indeed allied themselves with 
Hindus through the Khudai Khidmatgar’s alliance with the Congress 
Party, rather than forging ties with the Muslim League. Edward Frederick 
Lindley Wood, Lord Irwin, the viceroy at the time (r. 1926–31), invited 
Gandhi to discuss the subcontinent’s political future, and Gandhi agreed. 
After subsequent talks, in March 1931, the two signed the Gandhi-Irwin 
Pact, which restarted the stalled constitution-drafting process. Under its 
terms Congress would discontinue the civil disobedience movement and 
participate in a second Round Table Conference. The British government, 
for its part, would withdraw all ordinances issued to curb Congress, cease 
prosecution of all offenses relating to nonviolent civil disobedience, and 
release all persons serving sentences for their activities in the civil disobe-
dience movement.

The second session of the Round Table Conference, convened in 
London in September 1931, was intended to address the composition 
of the central government and, more vexingly, minority rights, or the 
communal issue, as it was known. Jinnah, Iqbal, the Aga Kahn, and 
Gandhi attended. However, the conference ended without results. On 
his return to India, Gandhi resumed the civil disobedience movement.

British prime minister Ramsay MacDonald (r. 1924, 1929–35), 
proclaiming himself a friend of the Indian people, proposed his 

PAKISTAN

The idea of a separate homeland for the subcontinent’s Muslims 
had been advanced, but the name of the nation-to-be was coined 

by a student at England’s Cambridge University. Chaudhuri Rahmat Ali 
wrote a pamphlet, Now or Never, calling for a federal state encompass-
ing the Punjab (P), Afghania (A), the NWFP; Kashmir (K); Sindh (S); 
and Baluchistan (Stan). His tract found its way to delegates at the 
Third Round Table Conference, but it was belittled as a schoolboy’s 
fantasy by delegates. Nonetheless, Pakistan soon became the term 
applied to the subcontinent’s Muslim majority area in the northwest.

own solution to the minority rights problem in August 1932. The 
Communal Award, as he called it, guaranteed all minority com-
munities, not just Muslims, the right of a separate electorate. The 
sudden recognition of the political rights of the Untouchables and 
lower castes was even more alarming to Hindus than the rights the 
communal awards bestowed on Muslims. Meanwhile, the weightage 
principle was misapplied in Punjab and Bengal, giving the majority 
Muslims minority representation in the provinces’ assemblies. In 
short, the Communal Award was unpopular among all Indian politi-
cal organizations. Nonetheless, the Muslim League agreed to accept 
it, while reserving the right to demand future changes. For Hindu 
political groups, the rights it would grant lower castes made the 
Award completely unacceptable.

The final session, the Third Round Table Conference, in November 
1932, was limited to discussing committee reports and accomplished 
little. Jinnah was not invited to the conference, because Conservatives, 
restored to power in England, considered him anti-British for his insis-
tence on equality and self-rule in the subcontinent. The ongoing antip-
athy between the Muslims and Congress overcame him. Discouraged, 
he moved to England and practiced law. But his retirement from politics 
and the independence movement was relatively brief. In 1934 Jinnah 
was reelected president of the Muslim League and that same year was 
elected to the Legislative Assembly. In October 1935 he sold his house 
in London and returned to the subcontinent.

What came out of the Third Round Table Conference was a white 
paper, published in March 1933, that became the basis for a reform con-
stitution. Parliament voted it into law two years later as the Government 
of India Act of 1935.

The reformed constitution granted almost complete autonomy to the 
11 provinces while preserving British control over the central govern-
ment. Muslims were given one-third of the seats in the central legislature, 
and another third would go to nominees of Indian princes. The right to 
vote was expanded to include about one-sixth of India’s adult popula-
tion. This led to a transformation of subcontinental politics. Political 
parties now had to appeal to commoners. They began retooling their 
messages as they sought viable candidates for the upcoming provincial 
elections. However, Muslim populations and leadership in Punjab, the 
frontier area, Bengal, and the new province of Sind were disunited. Some 
factions and power groups opposed the Muslim League. Baluchistan, 
under the rule of the latest of the khans of Kalat, Ahmad Yar Khan (r. 
1933–55, 1958), even refused to participate in the provincial elections.

THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE

Elections of 1936–37
Elections were held in the winter of 1936–37. The Congress Party won 
about 70 percent of the popular vote and 40 percent of the provincial 
government seats, but through coalitions gained an upper hand in the 
rule of most provinces. The Muslim League won only 5 percent of the 
total Muslim vote and not a single province, including the Muslim-
majority provinces, in which regional parties (in Bengal, Punjab, and 
Sind) and Congress (in NWFP) gained control. The Congress Party 
soon proved unwilling to include Muslims in their administrations. At 
the national level, Congress refused to work with Muslims unless they 
resigned from the Muslim League. Paradoxically, the reversal of Muslim 
fortunes revitalized the Muslim League. From a few thousand adherents 
in 1937 membership grew to a few hundred thousand by 1938, and a 
reported 3 million by the end of 1939.

At a meeting in Karachi in Sind, a province in which Muslims were 
still divided, 20,000 delegates gathered and heard the first official pro-
nouncement of the two-nation theory. Attendees resolved that it was 
essential to the interests of peace, cultural development, and the eco-
nomic, social, and political self-determination of Hindus and Muslims 
to revise the entire concept of the constitution.

As the decade ended, World War II began in Europe. Without 
consulting Indian government officials, the viceroy, Victor Alexander 
John Hope (r. 1936–43) announced that India would join the Allied 
cause. Congress answered by demanding immediate independence in 
return for its approval of the alliance. Britain refused, and in response 
Congress resigned on December 22, 1939. Jinnah declared it a day of 
deliverance and celebration marking the end of Congress’s rule.

The Lahore Resolution
In March 1940 in Lahore, Jinnah told 100,000 at a public meeting, 
“Muslims are not a minority as it is commonly known and understood 
. . . Muslims are a nation according to any definition of a nation, and 
they must have their homelands, their territory, and their state.” The 
position became Muslim League policy on March 24, 1940, as the 
Lahore Resolution. The resolution declared:

No constitutional plan would be workable or acceptable to the 
Muslims unless geographical contiguous units are demarcated 
into regions which should be so constituted with such territorial 
readjustments as may be necessary. That the areas in which the 
Muslims are numerically in majority as in the North-Western

and Eastern zones of India should be grouped to constitute 
independent states in which the constituent units shall be 
autonomous and sovereign.

Though the name Pakistan was never mentioned in the speech, the 
Indian press called the speech the Pakistan Resolution. The stakes and 
parameters of the political discussion of the subcontinent’s future had 
been irrevocably changed.

The Muslim League negotiated with British representatives over the 
terms of a future constitution and Muslim representation in return 
for their support of the British war effort. The viceroy proffered what 
became known as the August Offer of 1940, promising that no consti-
tution would be adopted without the consent of Muslim India, while 
denying the Muslim League the representation they sought on the 
Defense Council, an advisory war council under development. The 
Muslim League declined the offer.

Unrest spread in 1940 and into 1941. In Sind Muslim extremists waged 
jihad against the British. The British declared martial law and established

internment camps, confining people without food or water, and razing vil-
lages and farms. By mid-1941, some 20,000 people had been arrested.

As the conflict in the Pacific theater intensified, the British worried that 
Japan would invade India and realized local support needed to be shored 
up. In March 1942 Richard Stafford Cripps (1889–1952) arrived in India 
on a high-level mission to appease Muslim concerns. More than 1 million 
men from the subcontinent were now in the British Indian Army, and most 
were Muslims. Cripps offered independence for the subcontinent at war’s 
end, an assembly to draft a constitution, protection for minorities, and 
choice for the provinces as to whether to join the new Indian state. But 
without a guarantee for an independent Muslim state, the Muslim League 
rejected Cripps’s offer. Congress rejected the plan as well. Meanwhile the 
disruption wrought by war impacted the subcontinent in other ways: In 
1943 famine swept Bengal, and some 3 million died of starvation.

Jinnah and Gandhi
Against this backdrop of war and famine, the Muslim League, with its 
staunch demand for independence, gained more support in Muslim-

majority areas. It was now the dominant power in Punjab, Sind, and 
Assam and by spring 1943 had taken power in Bengal. The major-
ity of those on the subcontinent were eager for an end to the clash 
between Muslims and Hindus. Gandhi was adamantly opposed to a 
two-nation solution. In July 1944, Gandhi, just released from prison, 
proposed he and Jinnah meet. That September the two conferred in 
Bombay for six days. Gandhi had come, he said, on a personal mis-
sion, and not as a representative of either Congress or the Hindus. 
Gandhi tried to convince Jinnah that Muslim demands for a separate 
state were folly. Gandhi argued that the subcontinent’s Muslims were 
descendants of Hindus, proving the subcontinent’s historic unity. 
Gandhi was also worried that if Muslims pressed their demands, 
other minority groups would seek independence as well.

Simla Conference
In May 1945, with the end of the war in Europe in sight, Archibald 
Wavell, first viscount Wavell, the viceroy of India (r. 1943–47), 
returned to London to discuss the subcontinent’s future. After the con-
flict in Europe ended, in June, the Viceroy’s Council demanded immedi-
ate dominion status. Instead, Wavell, back from England, unveiled the 
so-called Wavell Plan at a conference in Simla in northern India at the 
end of June 1945. With the war all but over, the British no longer felt 
the need to appease the Muslims, who had comprised a major portion 
of the troops from the subcontinent. The British preferred to revert to 
positioning the Congress Party as the sole political representative of 
Indians. This preference was bolstered by close ties between Britain’s 
Labour government and the leadership of the Congress Party. At the 
Simla Conference, as it became known, all parties agreed that general 
elections would be held for central and provisional assemblies. But 
the Congress Party refused to recognize the Muslim League’s claim to 
be the sole representative of Muslim political aspirations; Congress 
wanted to be able to nominate Muslim candidates of their own in 
the upcoming elections. Meanwhile, the Sikh party Akali Dal and the 
Panthic Party opposed elections, which they saw as a step toward an 
independent Pakistan. These groups feared that a subcontinent divided 
along religious lines between Muslim and Hindu would have less toler-
ance for the aspirations of the subcontinent’s other religious and eth-
nic constituencies than would one unified nation. Additionally, many 
Pashtun political elements had stronger ties to the Congress Party, with 
whom the Khudai Khidmatgar had been allied, rather than the pro-

THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE

partition Muslim League. These and other disagreements and concerns 
scuttled the conference, and at its end, in mid-July, Wavell pronounced 
it a failure.

Despite the lack of agreement on the subcontinent’s political 
future, central and provincial legislature elections were scheduled 
for the winter of 1945. Wavell’s plans also called for the formation 
of an executive council and a body charged with drafting a constitu-
tion after the election. Jinnah rejected the plan, as it failed to provide 
for a Muslim state. Congress opposed it as well. Yet both parties 
recognized the results of the upcoming election would be critical in 
establishing their legitimacy and position in the subcontinent’s future. 
The Muslim League’s primary campaign platform was independent 
Muslim statehood. The Congress Party campaigned on the platform 
of a united India. Muslim League candidates won all 30 seats reserved 
for Muslims in the central assembly. Congress also did well, winning 
80 percent of the general seats.

Cabinet Mission Plan
In 1946 the British dispatched three cabinet ministers to settle the dis-
pute between the Muslim League and the Congress Party. The envoys 
first stipulated that the creation of two separate states was not a nego-
tiable option. The Cabinet Mission Plan, as it was called, proposed a 
single nation with a national government that would leave provinces 
virtually autonomous and free to write their own constitutions. The 
Muslim League accepted the proposal in principle, but when Congress 
refused to give the league what it felt was an adequate role in the pro-
posed interim government, the Muslim League refused to endorse the 
plan. The British authorized Congress to form an interim government 
without the Muslim League’s participation, though it was agreed some 
league members would be part of its final constitution. Muslim repre-
sentatives protested bitterly.

The Muslim League proclaimed a Direct Action Day on August 16, 
1946, calling for hartals—massive displays of noncooperation that 
would bring business and commerce to a standstill—demonstrations, 
strikes, rallies, and meetings. The display of Muslim unity brought 
a Hindu backlash. In Calcutta, where Muslims were a minority, 
sectarian violence that became known as the Great Calcutta Killing 
erupted. As many as 4,000 people of both faiths died. Some 15,000 
were injured, and 100,000 left homeless. The violence spread and 
continued into the fall.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Intransigence of Congress
In late August Wavell met with Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–
1964), son of Motilal Nehru and president of the Congress Party, and 
accused the Congress Party of reneging on its commitment to include 
the Muslim League in a national coalition government. He asked for 
their pledge in writing. Gandhi and Nehru rejected the request and 
sought to have Wavell recalled. Instead, the British instructed Wavell 
to form an interim government. In early September he announced the 
posts, naming Nehru as vice president and giving one of three key 
cabinet posts, that of the finance portfolio, to a member of the Muslim 
League, Liaquat Ali Khan (1896–1951).

A close ally of Jinnah, after graduating from Aligarh Muslim 
University Liaquat Ali Khan attended Oxford University and two years 
later returned to India with a law degree. His birthplace in eastern 
Punjab was among the first areas to agitate for a restoration of Muslim 
rights. The minority status of Muslims in this region made them acutely 
aware of the inequality they faced. But most of Punjab was a Muslim-
majority area, and here Muslims felt little need for political activism. 
The Unionist Party, dominated by landowners, had established what 
most saw as an equitable power-sharing arrangement. Khan joined the 
All India Muslim League and quickly rose in the ranks. He was also a 
member of the urban United Provinces Legislative Council, elected in 
1926, in which he served until 1940.

The Constituent Assembly was scheduled to go into session on 
December 9, 1946. Still, Congress remained opposed to a power-shar-
ing arrangement, leading the Muslim League, the Princely States, and 
the Sikhs to refuse to take part in the Constituent Assembly. Before 
the assembly began, the British prime minister summoned the viceroy, 
Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan, Nehru, and Sikh political leader Baldeve 
Singh (1902–61) to London to forge a power-sharing arrangement. 
Congress gave its approval to a plan the leadership agreed to, but again 
failed to implement the agreement. More minority groups boycotted 
the assembly.

The British were committed to handing over power no later than 
June 1948, but who would get the power and whether it would be one 
government or more was unknown. The British began a campaign to 
suppress Muslim protests and groups. The Muslim National Guards, 
the volunteer corps of the Muslim League, was banned, and league 
leaders in Lahore were arrested. Muslim League offices in Punjab were 
raided. In response, the league called for a civil disobedience campaign. 
The British banned assemblies, and tear gas met those that occurred.

THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE

But a Pakistan movement had built into an unstoppable force, spread-
ing across all facets of Muslim society.

Sectarian Violence Spreads
Across the subcontinent tens of thousands of Muslims, Hindus, and 
Sikhs lost their lives in sectarian riots and violence. Amidst this back-
ground of chaos and religious schism, the newly elected government 
took office. Predictably, progress on legislative matters was virtually 
impossible in this atmosphere. The finance ministry was now led by the 
Muslim League’s Liaquat Ali Khan, giving the league effective control 
of the government. The league was determined to leverage this power 
to fight for its objectives. Liaquat introduced what was called a “poor 
man’s budget,” calculated to hamstring the Hindu business class.

In March 1947 Louis Mountbatten (1900–79), first earl Mountbatten 
of Burma, was named the new and last viceroy (r. 1947). He toured the 
subcontinent upon his arrival, meeting its leaders. Some of what he saw, 
such as massive demonstrations in the frontier, convinced him of the 
depth of Muslim nationalism. Moreover, Jinnah told Lord Mountbatten 
that an independent Pakistan now had the support of Muslims across 
India and that Jinnah could not abandon the goal. The Hindu politi-
cal community also recognized the depth of Muslim determination. 
On March 8 the All India National Congress called for the division of 
Punjab. This was equivalent to sanctioning the partitioning of the sub-
continent. Congress was unwilling to work with the Muslim League, 
but realized the league was powerful enough to thwart any of its aims. 
The lesser of two evils was to jettison the Muslims, while doing every-
thing possible to block the development and success of their state.

Lord Mountbatten’s Plan
Lord Mountbatten developed an alternative plan to partitioning India. 
The details were completed at the Governor’s Conference in April 1947 
and approved in Britain in May; the plan called for the right of the 
Indian provinces to choose independence. The details of what became 
known as the June 3 Plan were to be kept secret until announced 
publicly, but Nehru was able to see the document before its release. 
Fearing the plan would lead to a balkanization of the subcontinent, 
Nehru rejected it. The plan was hastily revised by Lord Mountbatten 
and a Hindu assistant on his staff and refined by Nehru; it now pro-
posed a transfer of authority to the independent dominions of India

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

and Pakistan. Lord Mountbatten himself took it to London, where 
Prime Minister Clement Attlee (r. 1945–51) and his cabinet quickly 
approved the partition plan. Both Congress and Britain wanted to limit 
Pakistan’s size, and the Pakistan envisioned was smaller than the five 
provinces the Muslim League sought to include in the new nation.

On June 4, 1947, Jinnah, Nehru, Baldeve Singh, and Lord Mountbatten 
addressed the public in a radio broadcast and announced a plan to draw 
borders for the two new nations. Elected representatives in Sind, West 
Punjab, and East Bengal would determine territorial borders for their 
provinces. In the NWFP and parts of Assam, a plebiscite would be 
held. Baluchistan’s borders would be determined through a consulta-
tive arrangement. And in Bengal and Punjab, a commission would 
be appointed to delineate the boundaries between Muslim and non-
Muslim areas. The decisions on borders would remain secret until after 
independence. Mountbatten also made a surprise announcement about 
accelerating the transfer of power. Instead of June 1948, as previously 
planned, the transfer would take place on August 15, 1947—little more 
than a month from the date of the broadcast.

In late June 1947 Baluchistan decided to join Pakistan, as did the 
NWFP in a vote in early July. After Bengal chose to become part of 
Pakistan, a referendum in Sylhet, Assam, determined the parts of Assam 
that would join with Bengal.

The Indian Independence Act
On July 18 Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act, provid-
ing the foundation for establishing Pakistan and India as dominions 
of the British Commonwealth. The act also established the office of a 
governor-general for each of the two new dominions.

With partition imminent and sectarian passions further aroused, 
violence flared. But the road to independence now moved in only one 
direction. On August 11 the Pakistan Constituent Assembly, which 
served as both the federal legislature and the creator of the constitu-
tion, held its first session. On August 13 Lord Mountbatten arrived in 
Karachi bearing a message from King George he read to the assembly. 
On August 15 both Pakistan and India became independent. The dream 
of independence had been achieved. But the new nation of Pakistan 
would find its real challenges lay ahead.

THE CHALLENGES OF 

INDEPENDENCE 
(1947–1958)

Pakistan had won its independence, but the chaotic, violent state 
of the new federation created little cause for celebration. Born in 

spasms of massacre and flight, Pakistan was a nation physically divided, 
its East Wing (present-day Bangladesh) and West Wing separated by 
some 1,000 miles (1,600 km). Among the issues the new nation con-
fronted: Could it exist as two separate areas linked by little but religion? 
Was Pakistan to be secular or an Islamic state? How could it deal with 
the refugee crisis of Muslims spilling into its territory from India, and 
how to cope with the brain drain as Hindus and Sikhs fled Pakistan for 
India?

The India Independence Act, which granted statehood to both 
Pakistan and India in 1947, left it to principalities along border areas 
to decide which of the two new nations to join. Some that had been 
designated as part of Pakistan tried to assert their own independence, 
requiring military action from Pakistan to bring them forcibly into the 
union. The battle over the future of one, Kashmir, would provoke a 
war with India within two months of Pakistan’s statehood and remain 
unsettled into the following century. Pakistan would also fight a trade 
war with India, forcing it to find new sources for basic supplies that 
previously had come from its neighbor.

In yet another blow Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan’s founder and 
leader, died little more than a year after independence, creating battles 
over succession that also roiled the country. As the fractious divisions 
grew more visible and seemingly intractable, a senior military officer, 
General Mohammed Ayub Khan, seized power in a coup a decade after 
independence. These tumultuous events served as the milestones of the 
first years of the independent nation of Pakistan.

THE CHALLENGES OF INDEPENDENCE

Pakistan’s Difficult Birth
With the passage of the Indian Independence Act by the British parlia-
ment on July 18, 1947, Pakistan and India became sovereign states. 
The transfer took place on August 14, 1947, which is today celebrated 
as Pakistan’s Independence Day. (India chose August 15 as its inde-
pendence day, so it would not celebrate on the same day as its Muslim 
neighbors.) The Muslim dream of a homeland had been achieved.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Pakistan was a dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations. 
Muhammad Ali Jinnah was named its first governor-general. Jinnah 
selected the port of Karachi as the nation’s capital. Liaquat Ali Khan, 
Jinnah’s primary aide and political ally, was appointed the first prime 
minister.

The birth of Pakistan spelled the death of several political parties 
that had maintained power in the area by allying themselves with the 
Congress Party. These included the Unionists in Punjab and the Khudai 
Khidmatgars in the NWFP. Meanwhile, some formerly marginal groups 
gained power, such as the muhajirs, the refugees who had fled India at 
partition, in Karachi and lower Sind, and the middle classes of urban 
Punjab.

Communal Riots
The wrenching split from India defined Pakistan in the aftermath 
of independence. The antipathy toward its new neighbor, the hos-
tility between the two states, was an inseparable part of Pakistan’s 
identity and national psyche. Sectarian violence continued to wrack 
both new states, as communal riots erupted throughout Pakistan 
and India. Newly independent Muslims in Pakistan and Hindus in 
India, inflamed by religious and nationalist fervor, attacked members 
of minority communities. The violence prompted mass migrations 
of Muslims from India to Pakistan, while Hindus and Sikhs fled 
Pakistan for India. Massacres in Punjab alone resulted in almost half 
a million deaths in a matter of months. By the time Pakistan con-
ducted its first census in 1951, it determined some 14 million people 
had moved across the frontier: 8 million Muslims coming to Pakistan 
from India, and 6 million Hindus leaving Pakistan for India. Most 
of these people had to abandon all their possessions in their flight. 
No reliable survey of the number of people who lost their lives in 
the violence has ever been attempted, but it has been estimated that 
about 1 million people were killed. Additionally, as many as 50,000 
Muslim and 33,000 non-Muslim women were abducted by some esti-
mates (Menu and Bhasin 1998, 70).

The riots and sectarian strife destroyed property and infrastructure 
and created a vast sea of refugees who had to be clothed, housed, and 
fed by the poor nation. Pakistan had no real administration, as the civil 
service had been predominantly Hindu, and anyone of rank who had 
lived in what became Pakistan resettled in India. Moreover, the British 
had turned over most of their assets to India.

THE CHALLENGES OF INDEPENDENCE

Regional Challenges
Even the pieces of the nation remained to be assembled in the after-
math of independence. The day after partition, the khan of Kalat, 
Ahmad Yar Khan, declared Baluchistan an independent state. In 
October the khan traveled to Karachi to discuss Baluchistan’s future 
and the transferability of its treaties with the British should the 
Baluchis choose to align themselves with Pakistan. The two houses of 
the Baluchistan Assembly vetoed a merger with Pakistan. Jinnah trav-
eled to Baluchistan in an attempt to convince legislators to approve 
unification. But after hearing demands regarding recognition of 
Baluchi customs and privileges, Jinnah turned the matter over to his 
cabinet to resolve.

An autonomous government continued to enjoy support in the 
North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), whose leadership encouraged 
followers to ignore the edicts of Pakistan’s new rulers. Afghanistan’s

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

government also claimed rights within Pakistan, leading to a rupture of 
diplomatic and commercial relations between the two countries.

State Language Movement
The issue of the state language created a schism between East and 
West Pakistan during these first years of nationhood. Many in Bengal 
had hoped the area would gain independence as a separate state when 
the British withdrew from the subcontinent. When Lord Mountbatten 
announced the post-British division of the subcontinent on June 3, 
1947, he made Bengal a province of Pakistan, forestalling if not shat-
tering those dreams. Eager to ensure their voices would be heard in 
the new nation, many in East Pakistan wanted Bengali, the language of 
Bengal, to be the state language of East Pakistan and to share the dis-
tinction of the state language with Urdu, the language that dominated 
West Pakistan. West Pakistanis, who controlled the political power, 
planned to make Urdu alone the state language. In the months after 
independence the issue grew more acute. In November 1947 university 
students in Dhaka, the capital of the province of East Pakistan, staged a 
protest, demanding Bengali be made the state language. When the new 
nation’s coins and stamps were issued, they were in Urdu and English 
alone. Government officials explained it was an oversight, but in 
February 1948 the Constituent Assembly, formed the previous August 
to draft a constitution, refused to approve the resolution to make 
Bengali the state language of East Pakistan. Demonstrations continued, 
and a general strike was called.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah arrived in March of that year for a visit to East 
Pakistan. In a speech on March 21 he declared that Urdu alone would 
be the national language of Pakistan, further inflaming the public.

Indus Water Crisis
In another major challenge Pakistan’s water supply was disrupted by 
East Punjab in India. Pakistan was largely an agrarian society, and about 
80 percent of its agricultural production was in the Indus River basin. 
The plains of Punjab were the world’s largest irrigated agricultural area, 
comprising more than 28 million acres, and the partition line cut across 
this unique irrigation network, just as it split Punjab. The extensive canal 
system in West Pakistan dating to the British era in the late 19th and early 
20th centuries was dependent on the waters of the Indus. At the time 
of partition the British awarded the area in Kashmir that contained the 
upper basin of the Indus River, which had traditionally been in Muslim

THE CHALLENGES OF INDEPENDENCE

control, to India. The source rivers of the Indus—the Ravi, Beas, Sutlei, 
Jhelum, and Chenab—also remained on the Indian side of Punjab. In 
the aftermath of partition, negotiators representing the two nations were 
unable to agree on how the water from the Indus would be shared, and 
in a unilateral action, on April 1, 1948, the East Punjab government cut 
off the flow of water to every canal whose source it controlled.

Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan called for an immediate restora-
tion of the water supply and proposed an interdominion conference 
to resolve the dispute. Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru (r. 
1947–64) prevailed upon the provincial government of East Punjab to 
restore the flow of water, the lifeblood of Pakistan’s canals and irriga-
tion system. An arbitration panel was appointed, but no agreement was 
reached by the time the panel’s mandate ended in March 1948. In May 
representatives of the two nations met in New Delhi to take up the issue 
and at the conclusion of the talks signed the Inter-Dominion (Delhi) 
Agreement, which did little more than affirm that each country claimed 
rights to the waters of the rivers in East Punjab.

Progress on the water dispute came to a standstill as tensions over 
Kashmir, and the two states’ general animosity, overtook negotiations. 
Pakistan proposed submitting the water dispute to the International 
Court of Justice, but India refused. Even the Delhi Agreement yielded 
conflicting interpretations from each party. As positions hardened, the 
possibility of the dispute escalating into a major confrontation grew. 
India continued to block access to the water until Pakistan signed, 
under duress, an agreement on the division of the water. The issue 
would again be taken up in 1952, when India agreed to allow the World 
Bank to negotiate a new treaty. The final agreement, the Indus Waters 
Treaty—a landmark treaty in water-dispute resolution—would not be 
signed until 1960. In subsequent years Pakistan frequently cited the 
Indus water dispute as evidence of the necessity of third-party involve-
ment in resolving differences between the two nations.

The Princely States
The future of the Princely States, historically independent kingdoms, 
had yet to be determined. Some 560 of these semiautonomous prin-
cipalities existed at the time of independence, some in Pakistan and 
some in India. Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy, had stipulated that 
the states would decide for themselves which nation they would join. 
But at the time of independence, four had yet to make their choice: 
Junagadh and Jodhpur in northwest India, Hyderabad in the southeast, 

165

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

and Kashmir in the north. The first three had Hindu majorities and 
Muslim rulers; Kashmir’s population and rule were the opposite.

Junagadh was 80 percent Hindu, but in September 1947 its Muslim 
ruler, Muhammad Mahabat Khanji III (r. 1911–48) chose to join Pakistan. 
Neighboring Indian states reacted violently, and India sent troops to force 
him to reverse his decision. Khanji fled to Pakistan, and Junagadh joined 
India. In Jodhpur, the Muslim maharaja, Hanwant Singh (r. 1947–52), 
new to the throne, bent to Mountbatten’s pressure to join India.

Hyderabad, the largest and richest state in India, had a similar 
demographic profile, some 85 percent Hindu, led by the Muslim nizam 
Osman Ali Khan Bahadur Fateh Jung (r. 1911–48), who was reluctant 
to choose one nation over the other. Mountbatten again interceded, 
forcing the nizam’s approval of accession to India. However, remnants 
of Hyderabad’s independence were to be observed under a standstill 
agreement between the two states. Hindus who favored total absorp-
tion by India rioted against the agreement. India deployed troops to 
the region in Operation Polo, citing the need to restore order. Again, 
the display of military power forced capitulation, and Hyderabad com-
pleted its union with India.

The Kashmir Crisis
Kashmir was the last and most contested of the holdout Princely 
States. Here a Hindu, Maharaja Hari Singh (r. 1925–51), ruled over 
a Muslim majority of some 78 percent. The maharaja favored main-
taining independence, but Mountbatten urged him to join one of the 
new states by mid-August of 1947. Two Muslim parties, the Muslim 
Conference and the National Conference, dominated the debate. The 
Muslim Conference favored union with Pakistan, while the National 
Conference took a more secular approach to statehood, willing to 
accede to India in exchange for de facto autonomy.

In the interim the maharaja sought standstill agreements with both 
Pakistan and India, seeking pledges of nonintervention. Pakistan agreed, 
but India refused. Local Muslims began agitating for accession to Pakistan. 
They staged a large demonstration in August. Hindu troops opened fire 
on the crowd, killing several hundred. The action caused a revolt in the 
region of Poonch, which declared itself Azad Kashmir, or Free Kashmir. 
The revolt sparked a Muslim guerrilla war against the maharaja, and 
Pakistan suspended supply shipments to the principality. On October 23, 
1947, some 5,000 Pashtun tribesmen—Afridi, Waziri, and Mahsud from 
the NWFP—crossed the border into Kashmir, carried by Pakistan army

THE CHALLENGES OF INDEPENDENCE

vehicles. The irregulars reached as far as the outskirts of the Srinagar 
Valley. This area was the heartland of Kashmiriyat, the meaning and values 
of Kashmiri Muslim identity founded on traditions of Sufism and charac-
terized by tolerance for their high-caste Hindu neighbors. The maharaja 
fled to his winter palace in Jammu, and the Kashmiri prime minister asked 
India to send troops to stop the attack. Nehru agreed under the condition 
that the maharaja accede to having Kashmir join India. By some accounts 
Mountbatten had an understanding with Nehru that a referendum on the 
region’s future would be held later. On October 26 the maharaja chose to 
join India, and the following day India began airlifting troops to Srinagar, 
where they engaged the Pashtun tribesmen in battle.

The attack and occupation by Indian troops outraged Pakistan, which 
termed the accession coerced. Pakistan asked the United Nations (UN) 
Security Council to broker a cease-fire, so that a referendum or plebiscite 
could be held among Kashmiris, the results of which would determine 
which state they would join. With a large Muslim majority, a decision in 
favor of joining Pakistan was widely expected in any such referendum. 
Meanwhile, a large assault by Indian troops drove the Pashtun fighters 
back to the Pakistani border. In response Pakistan sent its own troops 
into Kashmir in May 1948, commencing a war with India.

UN Action
In August 1948 the UN Security Council called for an immediate cease-
fire under four guiding principles: withdrawal of Pakistani troops, 
withdrawal of armed tribal groups, installation of an interim civilian 
government under UN control, and withdrawal of most Indian forces 
after the departure of Pakistani and tribal forces. Additionally, after the 
terms of the agreement had been met, a referendum would be con-
ducted under UN supervision. Pakistan and India agreed to the terms. 
However, the resolution was not implemented until January 1, 1949. 
In March U.S. admiral Chester Nimitz (1885–1966) was appointed to 
oversee the referendum.

The cease-fire line was established in July 1949. The line is basically 
oriented east-west and then south. Jammu and Kashmir, which encom-
passes the Srinagar Valley, lies south of the border and is a member state 
of the Indian Union. Pakistan calls this Kashmiri Muslim heartland 
India-Occupied Kashmir. Hindus also cherish this region, for it is said 
to have been the scene of the development of important Hindu tradi-
tions. North of the cease-fire line lie the former tribal lands of Gilgit 
and Baltistan, now the Northern Areas, which are directly governed by

the Pakistan government. West of the line, Azad Kashmir, the former 
Poonch, is a semiautonomous state under Pakistani control. India 
refers to these areas as Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.

The referendum on Kashmir’s future was never held. The UN 
administrator who tried to engineer the vote concluded that the sole 
option to settle the dispute was to split Kashmir, while putting off 
decisions on the future of the hotly contested Srinagar Valley area. 
Thus began a volatile stalemate that would last into the 21st century 
and become the most contentious issue and flashpoint between the 
two nations.

A Change of Leadership
Jinnah had seen himself as uniquely capable of achieving independence 
for Pakistan. He also believed he was the only individual capable of 
overcoming Pakistan’s fractious political landscape and surmounting 
the problems plaguing the new nation. Many political observers at the 
time and since then have agreed. As Pakistan’s governor-general, Jinnah 
wielded much more power than authorized under the Government 
of India Act of 1935 or the India Independence Act of 1947. After 

Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan 
chaired the first cabinet meet-
ing, the cabinet asked the Quaid, 
or leader, as Jinnah was com-
monly called, to take charge of 
the gatherings. Jinnah’s role was 
so central that on December 30, 
1947, the cabinet accepted the 
Adoption of Convention, which 
decreed that no policy or major 
decision should be made unless 
Jinnah chaired the meeting. But 
Jinnah’s health had been dete-
riorating for several years, beset 
by tuberculosis and cancer. He 
tried to conceal his condition, 
fearing that any perceived weak-
ness would encourage potential

ule, and the appearance of vitality. When he died on September 11, 1948, 
Pakistan plunged into shock and grief.

Liaquat Ali Khan, Jinnah’s prime minister, emerged as the nation’s 
leader. Yet he could not replace Jinnah’s power and stature. Liaquat Ali 
Khan had to forge coalitions and win the support of various factions. 
Three of the most important were his base supporters in the commu-
nity of Karachi, the Muslim League constituency in Punjab, and the 
Muslim League constituency in East Pakistan. To win the support of the 
Punjabis and Bengalis, he delegated leadership roles to Muslim League 
figures such as Malik Ghulam Mohammad (1895–1956), from Bengal, 
who became finance minister; and Chaudhri Mohammad Ali (1905–
80), from Punjab, who became the highest-ranking member of the Civil 
Service of Pakistan. He also offered the position of governor-general to 
Khawaja Nazimuddin (1894–1964), a powerful Muslim League leader 
and chief minister of the province of East Bengal.

The Civil Service of Pakistan
Though the government seemed paralyzed, the business of state carried 
on through the Civil Service of Pakistan (CSP). The institution had its 
genesis in the prepartition Indian Civil Service (ICS). This had been the 
primary institution through which locals could attain advancement and 
position in the British-controlled society of the Raj; it attracted some 
of India’s best and brightest sons. At the time of partition, of the 1,157 
senior members of the ICS and the police service, only 101 were Muslims. 
Of the latter, 83 opted to relocate to Pakistan, as did some 7,000 lower-
level civil servants. But getting to Pakistan was difficult and dangerous, 
as the trains were unsafe, with marauding bands of Hindus hunting for 
Muslims. In a mission called “Operation Pakistan,” Pakistan chartered 26 
British airliners to fly the civil servants from Delhi to Karachi.

The civil servants arrived in a nation that had no administration 
to speak of. Managers who could staff senior posts were desperately 
needed, but none of the refugees held a senior rank equivalent to sec-
retary. The CSP, struggling to meet the need for technocrats, gave rapid 
promotions and paid some British administrators to remain on payroll. 
The CSP was sometimes called the “steel frame,” as it acted as the 
backbone of the nation. But early on its potential to achieve political 
power was also recognized. Jinnah instructed CSP members to stay out 
of politics. But after Jinnah’s death, no one had sufficient clout to keep 
the CSP on the political sidelines, and the institution came to have a 
large part in forging the nation’s policies.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

In 1973 various services were combined into one administrative 
system, and the CSP was disbanded. Former CSP members, however, 
retained critical positions in the country’s administrative apparatus 
even as subsequent governments came and went.

Economic Challenges
The new nation had little industry or industrial development plans. 
A total of 14,677 factories were registered in the subcontinent at the 
time of partition, but only 1,414 were in Pakistan. Of 394 textile mills, 
14 were in Pakistan. There were 106 mills to process jute, a major 
crop; none of the mills were in Pakistan. And what little economic 
power existed—banks and insurance companies—were mostly Hindu 
owned. Pakistan also had little cash on hand. Cash assets belonging to 
the subcontinent were to be divided, but the division of assets favored 
India. Moreover, India had control over the disbursements and delayed 
remitting Pakistan’s share, concerned that the money would be used to 
finance the conflict in Kashmir. For the same reason India also held up 
transferring military equipment that was due Pakistan. British general 
Claude Auchinleck (1884–1981), in charge of the transition to parti-
tion, was supposed to apportion military equipment between the two 
states, but, accused of being partial to Pakistan, he was recalled to 
England before Pakistan received its share of the hardware.

Liaquat-Nehru Pact
The ongoing violence between Muslims and Hindus continued to strain 
relations between Pakistan and India. In April 1950 Liaquat Ali Kahn 
and Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru met in Delhi to seek a 
solution to the sectarian strife. Both agreed their respective countries 
would protect the rights of their minority citizens and guarantee their 
equality, including the freedom of speech and worship. They also 
agreed that both nations would establish minority commissions to 
enforce these rights and punish those who tried to abrogate them. The 
agreement became known as the Liaquat-Nehru Pact. It was one of the 
first high-level demonstrations of the leaders’ awareness that the ongo-
ing animosity between the two states and their citizens had to be reined 
in for the benefit of both nations.

Foreign Affairs
Since independence Pakistan’s foreign policy has been based on a per-
ceived need to defend itself against its larger, richer, and better militarily

equipped neighbor and rival, India. This has required large budgetary 
expenditures for defense, impinging on the nation’s ability to make 
progress in other key domestic areas, such as health and education.

During his brief tenure Jinnah had no real opportunity to put his 
stamp on foreign affairs. As prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan pursued 
a policy of nonalignment. He tried to keep the nation neutral in the 
cold war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Soviet leader 
Joseph Stalin (r. 1922–53) invited Liaquat Ali Khan to Moscow in 1949, 
but he declined. In 1950, however, Liaquat Ali Khan called on U.S. 
president Harry S. Truman (r. 1945–53) in Washington, D.C., where 
he portrayed Pakistan as a democracy pursuing an independent foreign 
policy. Rather than recognize the nation as such, both the Soviet Union 
and the United States ignored Pakistan. Its neutral status proved costly 
at a time when Pakistan was desperate for assistance and allies. During 
his visit to the United States, Liaquat also sought Truman’s assistance in 
resolving the Kashmir dispute, without success.

Objectives Resolution
Another important task facing the new state was the creation of a legal 
framework for its governance. The new nation had no constitution 
of its own. Under the terms of Britain’s Indian Independence Act, the 
Government of India Act of 1935 became the working constitution of 
both new nations. However, Pakistan’s leaders were anxious to draft 
their own constitution.

Liaquat Ali Khan drafted the Objectives Resolution, which laid the 
groundwork for adopting a constitution. Also known as the Magna Carta 
of Pakistan’s constitutional history, the resolution was adopted by the 
legislative assembly on March 12, 1949. It asserted that Pakistan’s consti-
tution would be based on democratic representation and Islamic ideals:

Wherein the State shall exercise its powers and authority through 
the chosen representatives of the people; wherein the principles 
of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as 
enunciated by Islam, shall be fully observed; wherein the Muslims 
shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective 
spheres in accordance with the teachings and requirements of 
Islam as set out in the Holy Qur’an and Sunna; wherein adequate 
provision shall be made for the minorities freely to progress and 
practice their religions and develop their cultures.

The Constituent Assembly, established to create and ratify a con-
stitution and pass legislation until a constitution’s adoption, formed

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

committees to draft the document, led by the Basic Principles 
Committee. But Liaquat was unable to create a sufficient base of sup-
port to achieve a consensus on a plan for the constitution, and discus-
sions and negotiations progressed slowly.

The Basic Principles Committee laid out the preliminary plan in 
1950. It included provisions for equal representation in the upper 
house of the Central Legislature for East and West Pakistan, and that 
declared Urdu the national language. The plan met immediate opposi-
tion from representatives of East Pakistan, who objected to the equal 
division of power. East Pakistan contained the majority of the nation’s 
population but was given only half of the seats in the upper house of 
the Central Legislature. Disagreements over the Islamic nature of the 
republic created more dissension. Public comment was invited to assist 
in reformulating the plan for the constitution.

The Military
Monitoring the civil discontent, high-ranking members of the mili-
tary were also growing restive. Major General Akbar Khan (b. 1912), 
a veteran of the war in Kashmir, was among them. He was angered 
by Liaquat’s failed efforts to resolve the conflict over Kashmir and 
believed Pakistan could remove Indian troops from disputed territory 
by military means. On February 23, 1951, he met with several other 
senior Pakistani army officers at his home in Rawalpindi. Many senior 
officers had experienced rapid advances in the wake of Pakistan’s 
independence as the army expanded and top ranks were filled. Now 
that the military had been established and staffed, the lack of further 
advancement made some officers dissatisfied with civilian rule. The 
inability of the government to create a constitution and stable gov-
ernment institutions—which India had already accomplished—was 
another source of military discontent. At the meeting at his home 
Akbar Khan and his guests planned a takeover of the government with 
subsequent rule by a military council of senior generals. The meet-
ing and its aims, which became known as the Rawalpindi Conspiracy, 
were discovered by the government later that year. Several promi-
nent civilians with ties to leftist causes were also involved, including 
poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz (1911–84) and Sajjad Zaheer (1904–73), a 
Communist Party member. The conspirators were tried by a special 
military tribunal, convicted, and jailed. Most of them were released 
in 1955.

THE CHALLENGES OF INDEPENDENCE

Growing Unrest
The domestic political situation, never very stable or marked by integ-
rity, was deteriorating rapidly. Punjab and Bengal were both beginning 
to chafe under Muslim League rule. And the Muslim League itself was 
rent by dissent. The political leaders Liaquat had relied on to forge 
stability were becoming primary destabilizing elements. The military 
was no longer trustworthy. Liaquat decided he would try to bypass the 
political bosses and seek support directly from the public. He set off on 
a series of public rallies around the nation. At a large public meeting 
in Rawalpindi on October 16, 1951, he was shot at close range by an 
unemployed youth from the NWFP and died instantly. Liaquat’s assassi-
nation did not plunge the nation into turmoil. It had already descended 
into chaos and political instability bordering on anarchy.

After Liaquat’s assassination, Governor-General Khawaja Nazimuddin 
was named prime minister (r. 1951–53), as no other person was deemed 
suitable for the post. Finance Minister Malik Ghulam Muhammad was 
elevated to the post of governor-general (r. 1951–55). Born in Dhaka, in 
Bengal, in 1894, Malik Ghulam Muhammad attended Aligarh Muslim 
and Cambridge Universities. In 1929 he became provincial education 
minister in Bengal, where he championed educational reforms for rural 
people. In 1937 he was appointed as the home minister, and he became 
chief minister of Bengal in 1943. In 1947 he was elected leader of the 
Muslim League Party of East Bengal.

Work on the constitution continued. Nazimuddin was not a strong 
leader and was unable to gain control as political power struggles 
among subordinates increased. At the time of independence the eco-
nomic and social disparity between the East Wing and West Wing 
of Pakistan was immense. The unity Islam brought to the two wings 
barely overcame the physical and economic distance between them. 
The majority—55 percent—of the new nation’s population lived in 
East Pakistan. So its citizens believed the nation’s capital should be in 
the east. Additionally, the sale of jute, grown in East Pakistan, was a 
major source of foreign earnings, yet the profits were spent on projects 
that did little to benefit the east. Bengali nationalism began to rise. The 
Awami League, formed in 1949, answered nationalist political yearn-
ings in Bengal. One of its founders and later its leader, Sheikh Mujibur 
Rahman (1920–75), championed more autonomy for the provinces, 
especially for East Pakistan.

The issue of the state language burst forth again in 1952, when 
thousands of low-echelon government employees in East Pakistan

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

staged a demonstration demanding Bengali be named their official 
language. In January Nazimuddin came to Dhaka and, despite his ties 
to Bengal, reiterated that the national language of Pakistan would be 
Urdu. He argued that Urdu was the only language that could facilitate 
communication among the provinces, as most people in both West 
and East Pakistan had some knowledge of Urdu, while Bengali was 
spoken primarily in East Pakistan. He emphasized that Bengali should 
be used in the administrative and educational systems of East Pakistan. 
His statement further inflamed the public. On February 21 students 
staged an illegal protest that was broken up by police, who used tear 
gas and fired into the crowds. Some students were killed. As a result of 
these events public support for the Bengali independence movement 
increased dramatically.

The report finally prepared for and endorsed by the Basic Principles 
Committee called for a bicameral legislature. It proposed the nation be 
led by a Muslim serving a five-year term and chosen by a joint session 
of the Central Legislature. The leader would select the prime minister. 
A board of ulama, religious leaders, would vet all proposed laws to 
ensure they were compatible with the tenets of Islam. However, this 
revised report, presented to the national assembly in December 1952, 
and its adoption as the Objectives Resolution did not close the growing 
rift between East and West Pakistan that the first report provoked. A 
stalemate ensued as politicians representing each wing held up progress 
on writing and adopting a constitution.

The Government Is Dissolved
Ghulam Muhammad, who had made adoption of a constitution a prior-
ity, was frustrated by the lack of progress. The national assembly, show-
ing its own pique, passed a bill reining in the governor-general’s powers. 
Meanwhile, religious turmoil was spreading, stoked by Islamic theolo-
gians opposed to a sect they believed to be heretical, the Ahmadiyya. 
The Ahmadiyya sect was founded in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad 
(1835–1908), who claimed to have received revelations from God and 
proclaimed himself a prophet. This ran counter to Islam, which held 
that Muhammad, who brought forth the Qur’an, was the last of God’s 
prophets. Nonetheless, the sect had survived, and its adherents gener-
ally supported independence for Pakistan; many became muhajirs after 
partition, moving their headquarters from the Indian province of Punjab 
to a small town southwest of Lahore the Ahmadiyya founded, Rabwa. 
The Ahmadiyya believed that jihad was not a struggle against infidels

THE CHALLENGES OF INDEPENDENCE

but a battle to spread the word of God, a belief that made them fervent 
proselytizers. Many thousands in Pakistan, as well as in Africa, East 
Asia, and North America, joined the sect. Mainstream Muslim leaders 
felt threatened by the Ahmadiyya’s growing power and organization. 
In 1953 a group of ulama founded the Khatam-e-Nabuwat (Seal of the 
Prophets) movement in opposition. The group organized public dem-
onstrations demanding that the government declare the Ahmadiyya to 
be non-Islamic. The riots spread, and the violence is believed to have 
claimed some 2,000 lives.

Responding to the violence and the assembly’s efforts to curb his 
power, Ghulam Muhammad declared a state of emergency and dis-
solved the Constituent Assembly in October 1953. He thus became the 
first of several presidents who would remove democratically elected 
governments over the next half century. The Supreme Court upheld his 
action, determining the governor-general had the authority to dismiss 
the assembly and veto any legislation it passed. Ghulam Muhammad 
invited Muhammad Ali Bogra to resume the office of prime minister 
and to form a new cabinet dubbed “Ministry of Talents.”

The Bogra Administration
Muhammad Ali Bogra (r. 1953–55) was Pakistan’s ambassador to 
the United States at the time he was installed as prime minister. An 
aristocrat from East Bengal, he had been Nazimuddin’s parliamentary 
secretary, and finance and health minister prior to independence. 
Muhammad Ali Bogra pronounced formal adoption of the now-writ-
ten constitution a priority but promulgated an alternate plan called the 
Bogra Formula. It attempted to redress the imbalance of power between 
East and West Pakistan by setting aside an equal number of seats in the 
two houses of Parliament for each wing and stipulating that either the 
head of state or the head of government had to be from East Pakistan. 
It also provisioned that the Supreme Court, rather than the ulama, 
had the authority to decide if proposed laws were compatible with the 
tenets of Islam. The report was presented to the Constituent Assembly 
in October 1953, and a committee was appointed to draft the constitu-
tion under the Constituent Assembly’s auspices.

In 1954 Muhammad Ali Bogra named the commander in chief of the 
army, General Muhammad Ayub Khan (1907–74), minister of defense, 
marking the first time the military was directly involved in the country’s 
political process. Muhammad Ali Bogra also tried to settle the Kashmir 
dispute with India and met Jawaharlal Nehru in London in June 1953 

175

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

in an attempt to reach a settlement. Although the two established cor-
dial relations, Nehru refused to discuss the Kashmir dispute. That same 
year India forcefully suppressed a Muslim uprising in Kashmir, height-
ening tensions between the two countries. In August Muhammad Ali 
Bogra went to New Delhi to meet again with Nehru, this time wresting 
an agreement from him to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir. A series of com-
muniqués between the two sides over the next several months further 
refined plans for the vote.

Alliances with the West
Three days after Muhammad Ali Bogra’s nomination as prime minister, 
U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower (r. 1953–61) ordered thousands of 
tons of wheat shipped to Pakistan. That same year Ghulam Muhammad 
visited Eisenhower and came away from the meeting with a commit-
ment from the United States to consider providing military assistance 
to Pakistan.

At the time Eisenhower was seeking cold war allies along what was 
called Asia’s Northern Tier, which included Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. 
In 1953 the United States offered economic and military assistance in 
return for Pakistan’s agreement to join an alliance designed to check 
the spread of communism. In 1954 Pakistan signed the Mutual Defense 
Assistance Agreement and became a member of the Southeast Asia 
Treaty Organization (SEATO). Pakistan saw an alliance as a form of 
protection against India, though the agreement provided no guarantee 
that the United States would assist Pakistan in the event of aggression 
from India. But it obligated Pakistan to join in mutual defense against 
communist aggression. This was the price for the military and eco-
nomic assistance from the United States, which Pakistan saw as vital to 
whatever military force Pakistan could muster to counter India’s might. 
From 1954 to 1965 Pakistan received more than $1.3 billion in U.S. 
military assistance (Noor, n.p.). Defense minister Ayub Khan played a 
key role in negotiating Pakistan’s entry into its military alliances.

India reacted strongly and negatively to the pact. Nehru reneged on 
his promise to support a plebiscite in Kashmir. The Soviet Union threw 
its support behind India’s renouncement of a referendum.

Continuing its quest for international allies, in 1955 Pakistan joined 
Iraq, Turkey, and Iran in the Baghdad Pact. The administration saw 
the alliance as a way to strengthen relationships with other Muslim 
countries to foster more stability in the region. But the pact was bit-
terly opposed by Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser (r. 1956–70),

THE CHALLENGES OF INDEPENDENCE

the leading political figure in the Arab world and a vocal pan-Arabist. 
Nasser’s condemnation of Pakistan’s participation in the Baghdad Pact 
earned it the rebuke of the Arab world. The Baghdad Pact was renamed 
the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) after Iraq withdrew in 1959. 
Pakistan leased military installations to the United States as well, 
posts used for gathering intelligence and communications. The United 
States’s U-2 reconnaissance aircraft that was shot down over the Soviet 
Union in 1960, creating a cold war crisis, took off from a base near 
Peshawar in Pakistan.

Stabilizing the Economy
Fitful steps were taken to stabilize and expand the economy during 
Pakistan’s first decade. In July 1953 an economic planning board was 
given responsibility for identifying the human and material resources 
available to the country for a five-year period starting on April 1, 1954. 
But the repeated shake-ups of the government—five administrations 
between 1953 to 1958—left the government without ongoing economic 
expertise or stewardship. The board was unable to complete a draft of 
its five-year development plan until May 1956. It called for a 15 per-
cent increase in national income over the period 1955–60, which, after 
allowing for population growth, amounted to a slim 7 percent increase 
in per capita income. The plan advocated a more equitable distribution 
of land in agricultural areas and called for opening more administra-
tive jobs currently available only to Civil Service of Pakistan personnel 
to other technical-service professionals. At the time, however, political 
power was shifting to an alliance of landowners and the CSP, dooming 
chances for such reforms. Recommendations were debated for another 
two years. Finally, in May 1958 the plan was approved.

In August 1955 Ghulam Muhammad, beset by deteriorating health, 
resigned as governor-general. Major General Syed Iskander Ali Mirza, 
minister of the interior, succeeded him as governor-general (r. 1955–
56). A civil servant, Iskander Mirza felt Pakistanis were not ready for 
true democracy because of lack of education and democratic traditions. 
He favored a partial democracy, with the majority of power vested in 
civil servants. That same month Iskander Mirza dissolved the national 
assembly and dismissed Muhammad Ali Bogra and his government. 
Called on to rule on the legality of the removal, the supreme court 
showed the compliance to those in power it would repeatedly display 
in acquiescence to military takeovers. “That which is otherwise unlaw-
ful, necessity makes lawful,” the justices proclaimed (Raza, 1997, 8).

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Muhammad Ali Bogra returned to his position as the nation’s ambas-
sador to the United States, replaced as prime minister by Chaudhry 
Muhammad Ali (r. 1955–56).

Chaudhry Muhammad Ali and the First Constitution
Like prime ministers before him, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali placed a 
priority on creating a constitution. To resolve the imbalance of power 
between the West and East Wings of Pakistan, the four provinces of 
West Pakistan—Baluchistan, Punjab, Sind, and the NWFP—were 
merged into one province called West Pakistan, with Lahore as the new 
provincial capital. At the same time East Bengal became the province of 
East Pakistan, with Dhaka as its provincial capital.

A constitution was approved by the Constituent Assembly on March 
23, 1956. The constitution of 1956, as it became known, established 
Pakistan as an Islamic republic, ending its status as a British dominion. 
It had a parliamentary form of government with a unicameral legisla-
ture. The Constituent Assembly became the Legislative Assembly, and 
Iskander Mirza was made the nation’s first president (r. 1956–58), the 

ONE UNIT SOLUTION

The problem of how to balance resources and political power 
between the East and West Wings was never far from center 

stage. A school of thought advocated a “One Unit” approach to West 
Pakistan’s organization, uniting the four provinces of West Pakistan. 
It was thought this would help minimize the problems between 
East and West Pakistan by dealing with two wings instead of four 
provinces in the west and one in the east. Prime Minister Chaudhry 
Muhammad Ali announced this merger concept and plan in October 
1955. Iskander Mirza was an advocate of this approach. But regional 
rivalries within the West Wing complicated consensus. The popula-
tions of Baluchistan, Sind, and the NWFP were mostly opposed to 
the One Unit solution, fearing it would dilute what little voice their 
respective provinces had. Sind and the NWFP in particular chaffed 
at Punjab’s political and economic dominance. Nonetheless, the four 
provinces of West Pakistan—Baluchistan, Punjab, Sindh, and the 
NWFP—were merged in October 1955. Lahore was made the new 
provincial capital.

office that replaced that of the governor-general. Seats in the national 
assembly were evenly divided between East and West Pakistan repre-
sentatives. All citizens 21 years of age and older were given the right to 
vote. Urdu and Bengali were both recognized as state languages, while 
English was designated as Pakistan’s official language for its first 25 
years. The president was given the power to suspend provisions of the 
constitution in times of emergency.

Adoption of the constitution failed to stifle the dissension that made 
its creation so difficult. The parliamentary system created by the consti-
tution needed disciplined political parties, and the nascent democracy 
of Pakistan had no such institutions. The sole political party that could 
serve as a model, the Muslim League, was losing its focus and power, 
and its decline fragmented the political landscape.

The Muslim League, the only major political party in Pakistan at the 
time of independence, had been largely identified with its goal of an 
independent homeland for Muslims on the subcontinent, as well as by 
its two major figures, Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan. With independence 
achieved, the two leaders dead, and its surviving leaders split by regional 
rivalries, the party lost its broad-based support. It slowly came to be 
dominated by Punjabi landowners and bureaucrats. The party had been 
further split by the impasse over the constitutional debate. Regional 
disagreements over representation and the Islamic values the country 
would adopt as its spiritual foundation were stronger than party loyal-
ties. Muslim League politicians in East Pakistan, with a larger Hindu 
population, sought to establish a more secular state, which they saw as 
key to retaining broad support and power. But the Muslim League was 
adamant in making Pakistan’s Islamic identity a core issue.

Political Repercussions
Chaudhry Muhammad Ali was unable to unite the spectrum of lead-
ership to support the new constitution. Furthermore, he appointed 
a former Congress Party member who had opposed the creation of 
Pakistan, Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan (1882–1958), known by the honor-
ific Dr. Khan Sahib, as chief minister of the newly unified province of 
West Pakistan. Jabbar Khan purged Muslim League politicians from his 
cabinet and formed a new party, the Republican Party. Muslim League 
members in the national assembly urged Chaudhry Muhammad Ali to 
rein in Jabbar Khan’s actions in West Pakistan, but he refused, believing 
Jabbar Khan was acting in the best interests of the country rather than 
of an individual party.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

In 1954 two former members of the Muslim League from East 
Pakistan, Husain Shaheed Suhrawardy (1892–1963) and A. K. Fazlul 
Haq (1873–1962), joined a coalition of opposition parties called the 
United Front with the aim of defeating the Muslim League in upcom-
ing elections. Suhrawardy was the leader of the Awami League, which 
he had cofounded in 1949, and Fazlul Haq had established the Krishak 
Sramik (Workers and Peasants) Party.

Both men had held important positions in their abandoned party. 
Fazlul Haq had made the motion to adopt the historic Pakistan 
Resolution in 1940, and Suhrawardy had seconded it. But the West 
Wing’s control over the Muslim League drove both away from the party. 
Suhrawardy was chosen as the leader of the opposition in the second 
Constituent Assembly.

Bereft of support, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali resigned as prime 
minister and as a member of the Muslim League. He was replaced by 
Suhrawardy (r. 1956–57), who became the first non–Muslim League 
politician to hold the office. By now the Muslim League had even lost 
its majority in the West Pakistan Legislative Assembly to the Punjab-
centered Republican Party. Suhrawardy formed a coalition cabinet at 
the center that included the Awami League and the Republican Party. 
Though Suhrawardy enjoyed wide popularity in East Pakistan, he had 
no political base in the west, and his strong endorsement of the One 
Unit Plan cost him the support of all its provinces save Punjab.

Among his first challenges was the growing antipathy among the 
Muslim League and religious parties in West Pakistan to the joint 
electorate provisions he championed and the national assembly passed 
in October 1956. These provisions accorded greater voting power 
and rights to the nation’s minorities. Opposition to the One Unit Plan 
was becoming better organized. And the ongoing economic inequal-
ity between East and West Pakistan was another source of friction. 
Suhrawardy tried to balance the fortunes of the two wings, but was met 
by opposition from business interests in West Pakistan, who saw their 
power being diluted. President Iskander Mirza asked for Suhrawardy’s 
resignation; Suhrawardy agreed to give up his role in October 1957. 
Iskander Mirza selected Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar to serve as interim 
prime minister (r. Oct.–Dec. 1957). Chundrigar presided over a coali-
tion government that included the Muslim League, the Republican 
Party, the Nizam-i-Islam Party, and the Krishak Sramik Party. Though 
the Muslim League and the Republican Party typically worked in oppo-
sition, the Muslim League consented to taking part in the coalition 
under the condition that the Republican Party support its efforts to have

separate electorates. But after Chundrigar formed his cabinet, in the fall 
of 1957, the Republican Party began opposing the legislative amend-
ments required to overturn the joint electorate provisions. Unable to 
make headway from atop this crumbling coalition, Chundrigar left 
the prime minister post. In December 1957 he was replaced by Malik 
Feroz Khan Noon (r. 1957–58), a leader of the Republican Party in the 
national assembly. His ruling coalition included the Awami League, 
the National Awami Party, the National Congress, the Scheduled Caste 
Confederation, and the Krishak Sramik Party. Despite the large number 
of parties in his coalition government, Feroz Khan Noon was able to 
form a stable government and political chaos began to subside.

Military Rule
Iskander Mirza, who had exploited the divisions in Chundrigar’s coali-
tion to retain the upper hand in leadership, felt threatened by Khan 
Noon’s stronger and more stable ruling alliance. Religious and ethnic 
tensions also persisted. In West Pakistan chief minister Khan Abdul 
Jabbar Khan was assassinated. In the NWFP his brother, Khan Abdul 
Ghaffar Khan (1890–1988), declared his intent to work for indepen-
dence for the Pashtuns. And in Baluchistan, the khan of Kalat again 
declared his independence, requiring the intercession of the Pakistani 
army. Iskander Mirza, who already had the support of civil servants due 
to their distrust of politicians, tried to strengthen his position by forg-
ing alliances with politicians from other parties, including Khan Abdul 
Ghaffar Khan. But he was unable to undermine the coalition created by 
Feroz Khan Noon. With his attempts to assert control through political 
means failing, Iskander Mirza turned to extralegal means. On October 
7, 1958, with the cooperation of the commander in chief of the armed 
forces, General (Field Marshal) Muhammad Ayub Khan, Iskander 
Mirza declared martial law. Ayub Khan assumed the position of chief 
martial law administrator. The Constitution of 1956 was abrogated, the 
central and provincial assemblies dissolved. Elections scheduled for 
January 1959 were cancelled. The Muslim League was dissolved, never 
to be revived again.

Iskander Mirza and Ayub Khan presented themselves as dual lead-
ers, but the real power rested with Ayub Khan due to his control over 
the armed forces. Within days Iskander Mirza realized he had little 
control over Ayub Khan or the government. Iskander Mirza sought, 
unsuccessfully, to cultivate Ayub Khan’s rivals in the armed forces as a 
balance against the general’s power. Attempting blunter measures, on

October 24 Iskander Mirza removed Ayub Khan as head of martial law, 
appointing him as prime minister. On October 27, 1958, Ayub Khan 
had Iskander Mirza arrested and declared himself president. Ayub 
Khan was now the undisputed ruler of Pakistan and its military-run 
government.

MILITARY RULE 

(1958–1971)

Pakistan’s first efforts at civilian rule ended with the imposition of 
martial law under President Iskander Mirza, enforced by General 

Muhammad Ayub Khan. The public, tired of political gridlock and eco-
nomic stagnation, was ready to welcome change that promised stability 
and forward movement. Ayub Khan, who soon replaced Iskander Mirza 
in a coup d’état, promised to restore democracy but instead took greater 
authority for himself and failed to deliver democracy or progress. This 
set the pattern for all later military rulers who seized power from 
elected leaders, as Pakistan lurched between democracy and dictator-
ship for the next half century.

Pakistan’s problems would have been a challenge to any administra-
tion, with its poor, uneducated population; lack of public services and 
economic development; disparate ethnic and religious groups and sects 
that resisted assimilation; and intensifying estrangement between East 
and West Pakistan. All led to growing disenchantment with Ayub Khan. 
Within a decade of his coup, demands for freedom brought a temporary 
restoration of civilian rule. Yet Pakistan remained unsettled, the violent 
search for its identity and destiny leading to the 1971 secession of the 
nation’s East Wing, which proclaimed its independence as Bangladesh. 
The West Wing’s use of military force to end the rebellion led to a war 
with India, which came to the aid of the erstwhile East Wing, soundly 
defeating Pakistan’s army. The loss of both territory and the war with 
India shook the soul of Pakistanis. Political upheaval would wrack 
what remained of the nation in the wake of these events.

Ayub Khan Seizes Power
Within three weeks after President Iskander Mirza, attempting to retain 
power against a restive legislature, declared martial law on October 7,

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

1958, Commander in Chief Muhammad Ayub Khan seized power in a 
military coup. Ayub Khan was a Pashtun from a region of the NWFP 
close to Punjab and its more urban cultural influences. He had joined 
the British Indian Army, as had his father, and, by the time of British 
withdrawal in 1947, Ayub Khan was a brigadier general, one of the 
most senior Muslims in the corps. During partition he was appointed 
a member of the boundary commission, responsible for maintaining 
order in disputed territories whose borders had yet to be determined. 
He was later accused of being lax in preventing violence that swept 
these areas during partition.

After partition Ayub Khan was placed in charge of the army in 
East Pakistan, where he developed a contempt for politics and politi-
cians, as he later related in his autobiography, Friends Not Masters. 
He believed politicians were corrupt and undisciplined and politi-
cal institutions inherently inefficient. A professional military man, 
he favored a structure in which commands were obeyed without 
question, a far cry from the fractious world of Pakistan’s politics. He 
became convinced that democracy had to be limited in order to avoid 
being counterproductive in a struggling, fledgling nation. This view 
would become a cornerstone of his “Basic Democracies” governing 
policy after 1959.

In 1950 Liaquat Ali Khan asked Ayub Khan to be the nation’s first 
commander in chief, and in 1954 he became minister of defense. 
Unhappy with the civilian government, many Pakistanis supported his 
coup d’état against Irkander Mirza, and Ayub Khan used this goodwill 
to institute major reforms in the political, social, and economic fabric. 
Corrupt administrators were put on trial as part of his first demonstra-
tion of government reform. In all, some 3,000 public officials were dis-
missed, and many more were demoted. The military government also 
promulgated the Elective Bodies Disqualification Order, or E.B.D.O, 
which allowed the government to bar select politicians from serving 
in elective bodies until 1967, some nine years hence. Many politi-
cians who enjoyed widespread popularity, such as Hussain Shaheed 
Suhrawardy and Abdul Qayyum Khan, former chief minister of the 
NWFP (r. 1947–53), were “E.B.D.O.-ed” from office.

On October 27, 1959, Ayub Khan introduced the Basic Democracies 
Order, a plan that replaced the parliamentary system of democracy of 
the now-suspended 1956 constitution with an indirect elective gov-
ernment system. The doctrine was based on Ayub Khan’s belief that 
Pakistan’s largely illiterate population required a more limited form of 
democracy, one with reduced political and social freedoms. The system

was intended to slowly introduce the population to the workings of the 
government by limiting its decision-making powers to local govern-
ment and rural development. Ayub Khan called the form of governance 
“Basic Democracies,” while others called it representational dictator-
ship. The order created some 80,000 elective council seats, whose 
holders were charged with electing senior government officials. The 
public voted for the 80,000 representatives, members of village and 
town councils, who then elected members of the national assembly. 
Eighty thousand representatives may seem like a large number, but 
being officials, they were prone to pressure from Ayub Khan and his 
proxies more than anonymous citizens, and they represented less than 
one-thousandth of the population.

In an effort to curb the influence of landlords, whose concentra-
tion of wealth and power was deemed a threat to the government 
and an impediment to economic progress, Ayub Khan also undertook 
major land reforms in West Pakistan. The reforms limited the size of 
land holdings to 1,000 acres for nonirrigated lands and 500 acres for 
irrigated lands; for properties exceeding these limits, the excess land 
would be distributed to people chosen by the government.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Islamabad
After his coup d’état in 1959, General Ayub Khan was determined to 
relocate the capital from Karachi to an inland location. For Ayub Khan, a 
military leader, Karachi had several drawbacks as a capital. It was 1,000 
miles (1,600 km) from Rawalpindi, the site of the military’s general 
headquarters. Karachi was a cosmopolitan city, whose luminaries were 
business and industrial leaders; it was home to many muhajirs (refugees 
from India), who were often better educated and more literate than the 
people of Pakistan’s interior, and held more worldly views of events 
and news. Ayub Khan had little in common and no desire to associate 
with such people. And Karachi had little connection to the heartland of 
Punjab, where Ayub Khan had grown up. Ayub Khan appointed a com-
mission under Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, chief of the army staff 
(1917–80), to recommend a site for a new capital. The commission sug-
gested a location just north of Rawalpindi. A Greek urban planning firm, 
Doxiadis, designed the city, laying it out in a triangular grid pointing 
toward the Margaila Hills. The name Islamabad, or “city of Islam,” was 
chosen in an effort to placate conservative religious figures concerned 
about the secular tilt of the Ayub Khan regime. Work on the new city 
began in 1961, and the first residents arrived in 1963.

MILITARY RULE

The Constitution of 1962 officially made Islamabad the federal 
capital. But only the executive branch was based here. The legisla-
tive branch would inhabit a new city near Dhaka, in East Pakistan, in 
order to demonstrate to the East Wing its importance to Pakistan as a 
whole.

Resolving the Indus Water Dispute
Finally resolving the long-standing dispute between Pakistan and India 
over the Indus River’s water, in December 1958 Pakistan uncondition-
ally accepted the World Bank’s plan on the division of the waters. India 
had already accepted these terms. With Pakistan’s approval, the Indus 
Waters Treaty was drafted and, on September 19, 1960, signed. It gave 
Pakistan exclusive rights to the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab Rivers, 
which flow through West Punjab; India was granted exclusive rights 
to the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej Rivers up to the point they enter East 
Punjab. Additionally, during a 10-year transition period India was to 
supply Pakistan with waters from the eastern rivers. Pakistan used the 
transitional period to build and renovate massive water projects. These 
included dams at Warsak in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas; 
Mangla in Azad Kashmir; and Tarbela, some 30 miles (50 km) north-
west of Islamabad. The projects, which also linked canals, barrages, 
and other water works, were funded with $900 million in World Bank 
loans, monetary compensation from India, and contributions from 
Australia, Canada, West Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States.

The Constitution of 1962
The Basic Democracies system, with its relatively limited local repre-
sentation, left council seat holders vulnerable to Ayub Khan’s interfer-
ence and manipulation. Using these council members as electors, Ayub 
Khan held a referendum in February 1960, winning their approval to 
remain as president for five years and draft a new constitution. With 
his victory in hand, Ayub Khan established a commission to draft a new 
constitution and examine the reasons for the failure of the parliamen-
tary form of government he had terminated.

Since Pakistan had been founded in the name of the Muslims of 
India, appealing to religion was akin to appeals to Pakistani nationalism 
itself, and politicians often aligned themselves with Islam as a way to 
win over voters. The ulama, meanwhile, tried to wield influence over

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

the political process, using their sway over the masses and the politi-
cians’ need of their support to maintain power. General Ayub Khan was 
the first ruler to attempt to counter the power of the religious establish-
ment, setting the government on a secular course. In his book Friends 
Not Masters Ayub Khan accused the ulama of fomenting discontent and 
anger at the government: “They succeeded in converting an optimistic 
and enthusiastic people into a cynical and frustrated community,” he 
wrote (Ayub Khan 1967, 209).

The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, passed in 1961, made religious 
law subservient to secular rules. For example, the ordinance made it 
more difficult for men to take more than one wife, requiring the consent 
of the first wife for such a union. Ayub Khan discouraged the wearing of 
the burqa, the body-covering garment associated with religious conserva-
tism, and he sought to reduce the birth rate through family planning.

The commission’s recommendations for the constitution, delivered in 
May 1961, did not match Ayub Khan’s views. He consigned the recom-
mendations to a series of committees, and, by the time the document 
emerged for approval by the legislature, the constitution conformed to 
Ayub Khan’s blueprint.

The constitution of 1962, adopted in March of that year, consoli-
dated authority in the hands of the nation’s president. The president 
was to be a Muslim, his term would last five years, and he could serve a 
maximum of two consecutive terms. As head of state, head of the gov-
ernment, and commander of the armed forces, the president enjoyed 
absolute power. He had the power to appoint federal ministers and 
department heads, members of administrative commissions, and pro-
vincial governors. He anointed chief justices and judges of the supreme 
and high courts.

The constitution also mandated that Pakistan be renamed the Republic 
of Pakistan and the word Islamic be dropped from the nation’s name, 
hewing to Ayub Khan’s preference for a secular government. However, 
the majority of the National Assembly favored restoring Islamic to the 
republic’s name, and the first amendment to the 1962 constitution, 
passed in December of that year, made the nation the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan once again. The constitution mandated the establishment 
of the Advisory Council of Islamic Ideology to generate ideas for ways 
Muslim citizens could hew more closely to Islamic principles. The con-
stitution also incorporated Ayub Khan’s Basic Democracies plan and its 
system of indirect representational government.

The unicameral legislature consisted of a National Assembly of 156 
members. The president had veto power over any legislation approved

by the assembly and had the power to dismiss its members. He could 
also make law when the legislature was not in session. And though 
these laws needed the eventual approval of the assembly, the president 
also had absolute power to declare a state of emergency, which abro-
gated the need for legislative approval.

Any future constitutional amendment would require a two-thirds 
majority of the National Assembly and presidential approval. The 
Constitution of 1962 retained the principle of parity from the 1956 
constitution, providing for equal representation for each of the two 
wings of the nation. It retained the One Unit concept for West Pakistan. 
Urdu and Bengali remained national languages, and English the official 
language for 10 years.

With the new constitution in place in March 1962, martial law was 
ended. A civilian government took the place of the military leaders who 
had ruled since Ayub Khan had gained power.

The Economy
The new decade marked the conclusion of the country’s first five-year 
plan, which had been belatedly implemented more than halfway into 
its intended time span. Economic growth had fallen short of its goals 
during the 1955–60 period. Per capita income had increased by less 
than 1 percent. The growth in the industrial, agricultural, housing and 
settlement, transport, and communications sectors was below the very 
modest targets.

Ayub Khan had promised Pakistan an improved economy, but 
failed to deliver results. Having not achieved his initial objective, he 
appointed himself chairman of the planning commission overseeing 
the second five-year economic plan. The staff was strengthened, and 
more foreign advisers were added to the roster of those already provid-
ing planning assistance. Approved in June 1960, a few days prior to the 
start of the 1961 fiscal year, the new plan was focused on accelerated 
economic growth. It contained no provisions for increasing social ser-
vices or alleviating poverty. The plan’s budget of 29 billion rupees ($6.1 
billion), allotted just under half (48 percent) of expenditures to public 
services such as water and power, agriculture, transport, and communi-
cation. Only 8 percent was earmarked for health, education, and social 
welfare, though Ayub Khan stressed the need for educational reform. 
“There exists a fundamental justification for inequality of income if it 
raises production for all and not consumption for a few,” the commis-
sion’s chief economist, Mahbubul Haq, wrote in the plan “The road

to eventual equalities may inevitably be through initial inequalities” 
(Burki 1980, 73).

Of the rest of the development budget, the private sector would 
receive 39 percent of available funds, and 10 percent would be spent 
on Indus waterworks. Local councils established under the Basic 
Democracies would get 3 percent to spend on rural works programs of 
their choosing.

The plan achieved its goal of accelerating economic growth. Between 
1960 and 1965 the nation’s gross national product (GNP) grew at an 
annual rate of 5.2 percent. However, population growth was greater 
than anticipated, resulting in a small growth in income—barely a 2.7 
percent per capita annual increase. Notably, East Pakistan’s economy 
grew slightly faster than the more industrialized and prosperous West 
Wing. (West Pakistan’s increase in per capita income for this period was 
a slight 2.4 percent.) The economic expansion and superficial political 
tranquility made the Ayub Khan regime a model for third world devel-
opmental success, cited by many international experts and chroniclers 
of the era.

1965 Presidential Elections
The 1965 elections were not only a presidential contest but a ref-
erendum on the autocratic government Ayub Khan instituted and 
embodied. The Convention Muslim League, of which Ayub Khan was 
president, and the Combined Opposition Parties were the two political 
parties in the election. The Combined Opposition Parties consisted of 
five different opposition groups. Its platform included a return to direct 
democracy and restoration of constitutional democratic principles. But 
the parties were combined in name alone. Unable to select a candidate 
from the party leaders among them, they turned to Fatima Jinnah, 
sister of Pakistan’s first president and father of the nation, Muhammad 
Ali Jinnah, the Quaid. Fatima Jinnah, herself a veteran of the Freedom 
Movement, was known as the Madar-i-Millat, or Mother of the Nation. 
She had been absent from the political landscape since independence 
and largely quiescent to Ayub Khan’s rule, despite her support of demo-
cratic ideals. The only other presidential contestants were two largely 
unknown candidates unidentified with any political party.

The names of the presidential candidates were made public before 
the Basic Democracies elections took place. The 80,000 electors (a 
number that would grow to 120,000 under the eighth amendment to 
the constitution) chosen in that contest would vote for the president

and legislators. One month was allotted for the campaign, which was 
restricted to nine meetings open only to electors and the press. The 
campaign process hobbled the candidates. Nonetheless, Fatima Jinnah’s 
campaign generated great public enthusiasm. Large crowds greeted 
her as she traveled through the East and West Wings of the nation. 
She declared Ayub Khan a dictator and claimed he had signed over 
Pakistan’s water to India in the Indus Waters Treaty. Some major ortho-
dox religious parties, which had previously maintained a woman could 
not lead an Islamic republic, supported Jinnah’s candidacy. But despite 
her popular appeal, the Basic Democracy system of electors almost 
guaranteed Jinnah’s defeat, due to the president’s ability to influence 
and manipulate the votes of the 80,000 Basic Democrats who elected 
National Assembly members. This assured Khan’s backers gained the 
majority of seats in the assembly, whose members in turn elected the 
president. Ayub Khan was reelected president on January 2, 1965.

A New Foreign Policy and the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War
At the beginning of the 1960s Pakistan and the United States main-
tained their military alliance. The United States had leased three air 
bases from Pakistan that played a key part in the cold war. However, 
Pakistan’s interest in the alliance was not so much to counter commu-
nism but to offset India’s might. Relations deteriorated when leaders in 
Islamabad began to feel a U.S. tilt toward India; to address the military 
disparity Pakistan began to explore relations with China and the Soviet 
Union.

Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1928–79), then Ayub Khan’s minister of fuel, 
power, and natural resources, was the first government official to turn 
Pakistan toward the Soviet axis. Bhutto believed Pakistan had large 
reserves of oil and gas and was frustrated that the Western oil compa-
nies with concessions in Pakistan were not exploring and finding these 
resources. In 1961 Bhutto negotiated an exploration agreement with the 
Soviet Union. The Soviets also agreed to provide technical and financial 
assistance to Pakistan’s Oil and Gas Development Corporation. The 
agreement had little lasting impact on Pakistan or its energy industry.

Closer ties to China were also forged in the early 1960s. China 
and Pakistan shared a common border, and China was eager to foster 
improved relations, neutralizing whatever threat SEATO (Southeast 
Asia Treaty Organization) member Pakistan, at its back door, rep-
resented. Throughout these years Pakistan had continued efforts to 
resolve the Kashmir crisis, primarily by seeking the long-promised

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

plebiscite, which had been approved by the United Nations and agreed 
to by Pakistan and India. But India refused to schedule a plebiscite, find-
ing reason upon reason for its intransigence. A former Indian defense 
minister, Krishna Menon, once candidly explained why: “Kashmir 
would vote to join Pakistan and no Indian government responsible for 
agreeing to plebiscite would survive” (Mahmood 2000, 191). In fall 
1962 a long-standing border dispute between India and China turned 
into open warfare. Western nations pressured Pakistan to assure India 
it would not use the distraction of the conflict with China to engage in 
any military adventures in Kashmir. At the same time India used the 
border war with China, an archenemy of the United States, to leverage 
more military assistance from the United States. Pakistan feared the 
purpose of the massive buildup in the Indian military was to create an 
army capable of conquering Pakistan. Seeking to counter India’s sus-
pected intentions, Pakistan began efforts to normalize relations with 
China. Angered at what it saw as Pakistan’s new communist partiality, 
the United States suspended economic aid to Pakistan, though not 
all military assistance. During its war with China, India invited Ayub 
Khan to discuss a resolution to the Kashmir situation. The two sides 
met in November 1962, but soon after China announced a unilateral 
cease-fire following a quick defeat of the Indian army. With an end to 
the Sino-Indian border dispute, the talks over Kashmir stalled, ending 
in May 1963.

Upon the death of Foreign Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra in 1963, 
Zulfikar Bhutto convinced Ayub Khan to appoint him foreign minis-
ter. Under Bhutto’s foreign-policy leadership, a border agreement with 
China was reached, and closer commercial links were established. 
Scheduled airline service between the two countries was instituted, and 
China pledged to build a major military-industrial complex near Wah, 
in Punjab. In February 1964 Ayub Khan made a state visit to China and 
won its support for a plebiscite in Kashmir.

In March 1965 Kashmir’s legislative assembly adopted constitutional 
amendments that ceded the power to select the region’s ruler to India. 
Kashmir’s Muslim majority strenuously objected and set up a govern-
ment of their own, a national government of the people of Jammu and 
Kashmir. In April confrontations between India and Pakistan erupted at 
the Rann of Kutch. Occupying some 3,500 square miles (9,100 sq. km) 
between Sind and the princely state of Kutch, the Rann (Hindi for “salt 
marsh”) had been disputed territory before joining India at the time of 
partition. Pakistan easily defeated India and a United Nations–brokered 
cease-fire ended the conflict.

MILITARY RULE

Encouraged by its military success in southern Pakistan and 
believing that the population of Kashmir could be incited to rise up 
against Indian occupiers, the Pakistani government decided to seek 
a military solution to Kashmir. Starting on August 5, 1965, under a 
plan code named “Operation Gibraltar,” thousands of mujahideen 
were infiltrated into Kashmir. The mujahideen were to provide weap-
ons and leadership once the revolt began. But the operation failed 
to incite an insurrection and only escalated tensions in the region. 
Indian prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri (r. 1964–66) tried to 
control contested Kashmir by imposing presidential rule and assert-
ing the right to enforce legislation. Kashmir’s Muslim ruler, Sheikh 
Muhammad Abdullah (1905–82), was arrested for trying to block 
India’s efforts. Protests against India’s attempt to impose rule erupted 
in Azad Kashmir. In response, the Indian army crossed the cease-fire 
line to battle Muslim forces.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Full-scale war began on September 6, when India launched a mas-
sive air, armor, and infantry attack on Lahore, Sialkot, and Rajasthan. 
Pakistani troops invaded India at several points along the border. 
Seeking to contain the conflict, both the United States and the Soviet 
Union sought UN intervention. In Pakistan much of the public was 
in favor of going to war with India over Kashmir, particularly since 
Pakistanis thought they had the upper hand in the conflict and would 
defeat the Indian forces. The United Nations arranged a cease-fire, 
which took effect on September 23, 1965. Afterward, the Soviet Union 
sponsored a peace conference at Tashkent, in what is today Uzbekistan. 
Attended by Ayub Khan and Indian prime minister Shastri as well as 
Soviet premier Aleksey Kosygin (r. 1964–80), the Tashkent Conference 
commenced on January 4, 1966. Under the Tashkent Declaration, 
issued at its conclusion, Pakistan and India agreed to withdraw their

forces by February 25 to positions held prior to August 5, 1964, and 
agreed to attempt to normalize relations and renounce the use of force 
to settle disagreements. The agreement, which favored neither nation, 
stunned many Pakistanis, who felt they were winning the war. For 
them the declaration represented a humiliation. Public protest and riots 
broke out across Pakistan. On January 14 Ayub Khan addressed the 
nation on the reasons for signing the declaration. Though he was able 
to make his case to the majority of Pakistanis, his position was greatly 
weakened in the wake of the peace negotiations.

Economic Fallout
The Indo-Pakistan War was disastrous for Pakistan. It strained Pakistan’s 
economy and drained the treasury at a time when the country was 
preparing to implement the Third Five-Year Plan. Eager to improve 
upon Pakistan’s economic record, the Second Five-Year Plan became 
the model for the third, covering the years 1965–70. In addition to 
accelerating economic growth, the plan sought to reduce the economic 
disparity between the East and West Wings. By the end of the Second 
Five-Year Plan, East Pakistan was getting half of all Pakistan’s invest-
ment in public-sector development. But when the war with India over 
Kashmir broke out in the first year of the third plan, developmental 
resources were diverted to the military. The drain slowed even the 
development of the new capital, Islamabad. The presidency and sev-
eral departments took temporary offices in Rawalpindi. Ultimately the 
plan’s basic economic goals were realized. By the last year of the plan 
the GNP increased at the rate of 5.5 percent annually, and per capita 
income rose 2.7 percent. But the rising income was not shared equally, 
and many Pakistanis were experiencing economic stagnation.

Meanwhile, the failure to unite the two wings successfully and 
widespread corruption plaguing Pakistan’s institutions left the public 
disillusioned with the government. The war also convinced many in 
the East Wing that their country was incapable of providing adequate 
military protection, bolstering supporters of greater rights and even 
independence for Bengal.

Growing Unrest
People were looking for new leadership, and it came from a charismatic, 
energetic populist, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. One of Ayub Khan’s key aides, 
at age 30 Bhutto became the youngest cabinet minister in the nation’s

history, holding several posts. Born in Sind in 1928 on the banks of 
the Indus, Zulfikar Bhutto was the only son of a wealthy landowner 
and noted politician, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto (d. 1949), a supporter 
of Pakistani independence. His mother was a Hindu of lower social 
standing who converted to Islam before her marriage. Zulfikar Bhutto 
inherited most of the landholdings upon his father’s death. He attended 
the University of California at Berkeley and Oxford University, earning 
a law degree. Returning to Karachi in 1953, he began to practice at the 
bar. Two of his four children, daughter Benazir (1953–2007) and son 
Shahnawaz (1958–85), named for his grandfather, would themselves 
play large roles in Pakistan’s politics.

Zulfikar Bhutto became the first politician to turn Pakistan toward 
the Soviet Union. In 1961 he engineered an oil and mineral exploration 
agreement with the Soviet Union. Bhutto’s ability to get Ayub Khan to 
agree to his plan was a sign of Bhutto’s growing influence. The project 
itself had little lasting impact on Pakistan or its energy industry. In 
1963, he was appointed foreign minister. In a book he published after 
resigning from Ayub Khan’s government, The Myth of Independence, 
Bhutto made a case for his foreign policy, asserting any relationship 
between unequal powers such as Pakistan and the United States was 
destined to produce autocratic, subservient leaders in the weaker coun-
try. It was Bhutto who championed Operation Gibraltar, the failed effort 
to stir an uprising in Kashmir that preceded the war with India over 
the disputed territory. He adamantly opposed the Tashkent Declaration, 
and left Ayub Khan’s government and party in 1966 over its acceptance. 
After weighing offers from several opposition groups, in 1967 Bhutto 
founded his own party the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP). It was already 
a tradition in the short history of Pakistani politics for noted opposition 
figures to found their own parties rather than play a secondary role in 
someone else’s organization. The cult of personality and lack of party 
strength and durability contributed to the fractious history of Pakistani 
politics then as it does now.

Despite public anger over the war’s aftermath, Ayub Khan felt secure 
enough in office to schedule elections. He also arranged a celebration 
in 1968 to mark a decade of his rule. But he failed to grasp the depth 
of opposition to his government. Zulfikar Bhutto’s populist platform of 
nationalism, socialism, and Islamic revivalism generated vigorous sup-
port. Making the defeat of Ayub Khan his priority, Bhutto embarked on 
a nationwide tour, denouncing Ayub Khan along the way. In November 
1968, Bhutto and several supporters were arrested for their campaign 
activities and incarcerated for three months. The detentions further

inflamed the opposition. The Awami League in East Pakistan also 
stood against Ayub Khan, accusing him of being unconcerned with 
East Pakistan’s problems. The nation’s other political parties banded 
together in an alliance, the Democratic Action Committee, to bring 
down Ayub Khan’s regime. By the end of 1968, dissatisfaction with 
Ayub Khan’s regime had spread across the middle class. The Joint Labor 
Council called for a labor strike to protest Ayub Khan’s rule.

Ayub Khan tried to diffuse the growing opposition by releasing sev-
eral jailed political figures in 1969, including East Pakistan’s most pop-
ular politician, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (1920–75). In 1966 Mujibur 
Rahman had proposed a six-point program for provincial autonomy 
and had been imprisoned since being implicated in a 1968 conspiracy 
to gain independence for the East Wing.

Attempting to rein in the growing political unrest, Ayub Khan 
scheduled a Round Table Conference in Rawalpindi in March 1969, 
bringing together all the major Pakistani political figures. But opposi-
tion remained steadfast. With protests and demonstrations convulsing 
the country, he resigned on March 25, 1969, turning power over to the 
army’s commander in chief, General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan (r. 
1969–71). Yahya Khan proclaimed martial law, but soon announced 

“22 FAMILIES”

In a speech in April 1968, noted economist and member of the 
planning board Mahbub ul Haq (1934–98) spoke out about the con-

centration of wealth that had occurred during Ayub Khan’s regime. He 
presented data regarding ownership of companies listed on the Karachi 
Stock Exchange and suggested that 22 families, which he named, 
controlled two-thirds of the nation’s industrial assets. Though he 
ignored the small- to medium-sized fi rms that had played a large role 
in Pakistan’s economic growth during the decade, his underlying thesis 
that the rich had gotten much richer and the poor much poorer during 
the 1960s struck a responsive chord. From this speech the expression 
“22 families” entered the political lexicon, shorthand for the income 
concentration and economic exploitation upon which the economy 
was built. Zulfi kar Bhutto bolstered his populist appeal with frequent 
blistering verbal attacks against the industrialist families. Haq’s speech 
helped set in motion the thinking and action that led to the nationaliza-
tion of heavy industries that would occur on January 1, 1972.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

general elections would be held in October 1970. However, since the 
Constitution of 1962 had been voided, there was no legal basis for 
holding an election.

Talks were held with political figures in April and July 1969 to deter-
mine a way to proceed. Most opposition politicians favored a return to 
the constitution of 1956, believing that it had been illegally abrogated. 
However, the Awami League opposed this solution, as they did not feel 
East Pakistan was treated fairly under the Constitution of 1956. Yahya 
Khan appointed a commission to develop a new plan for a constitution, 
which was presented in March 1970. Known as the Legal Framework 
Order 1970, its highlights included the dissolution of the One Unit 
arrangement in West Pakistan and a restoration of direct balloting in 
place of parity, which would give the more populous East Pakistan 
greater representation. Though representatives who won seats in the 
election were to draft the constitution, the document was to be based 
on principles defined by the Legal Framework Order.

East Pakistan
Ayub Khan’s departure did little to quell the unrest in East Pakistan. 
The constitution of 1956 had been accepted in the East Wing in the 
belief that the federal government would take genuine steps to end the 
economic and political disparities between the two wings. The consti-
tution of 1962 had been forced on the East Wing under Ayub Khan’s 
martial law that prevailed at the time. But as Ayub Khan’s power weak-
ened, Bengalis became more restive and vocal.

In an effort to assure fairness in the economic planning process, the 
economic planning commission developing the Fourth Five-Year Plan 
established parallel panels of economic experts, one from East Pakistan 
and one from West Pakistan. Each was to study changes in the nation’s 
economy during the preceding five years and recommend policies and 
tactics in response. The economists from East Pakistan presented evi-
dence of a widening disparity, requiring profound shifts in policy to 
reverse the trend. The West Pakistan panel’s data indicated the disparity 
between East and West was quickly evaporating and would be greatly 
reduced if not eliminated without intervention by the mid-1980s. The 
opposing views were not reconciled before the draft of the five-year 
plan was presented in the spring of 1970. But the issue of regional dis-
parity would soon become moot.

As the National Assembly’s 1970 elections approached, the Awami 
League Party presented a six-point program aimed at restoring democ-

198

racy and advancing East Pakistan’s position. It called for a restoration 
of a parliamentary form of government and for limiting the federal 
government’s role to defense and foreign affairs. It also called for eco-
nomic and legal reforms to erase the disparities between East and West 
Pakistan, and for East Pakistan, which had no military force of its own, 
to have a militia or paramilitary force.

General Elections
No general elections had been held in Pakistan since 1947. The govern-
ment faced the challenge of registering all eligible voters and prepar-
ing for nationwide balloting. Campaigning began on January 1, 1970. 
When registration was completed in March, 56,941,500 people were on 
the voter rolls, 31,211,220 of them from East Pakistan, and 25,730,280 
from West Pakistan. A total of 1,579 candidates from 24 political par-
ties ran for the 300 National Assembly seats. The Awami League and 
Zulfikar Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party drew the most public support 
as the campaign intensified. The Awami League campaigned on its 
six-point program, while the PPP represented socialistic ideals under 
the banner of “Rotti, Kapra aur Makan” (Food, Clothing, and Shelter). 
Bhutto also called for a 1,000-year war against India. Religious parties 
such as Jamaat-i-Islami, or Islamic Party, campaigned on a platform 
of greater Islamization for the country, while leftist parties promoted 
regional and socialist agendas.

Elections for the National Assembly were scheduled for October 5, 
and for provincial assemblies, October 19. However, due to floods and 
cyclones in East Pakistan, elections had to be rescheduled and were 
not completed until January 17, 1971. When the election results were 
tabulated, the Awami League, led by Mujibur Rahman, won a stunning 
victory and emerged as Pakistan’s major political power, winning 160 
of the National Assembly’s 300 seats. The Awami League also won 288 
of the 300 seats in the East Pakistan assembly, though it won no seats 
in any of West Pakistan’s four provincial assemblies. The PPP won 81 
of the 138 seats in the National Assembly reserved for West Pakistan, 
making it the dominant power in that wing.

Civil War
With a clear majority in the National Assembly, the Awami League was 
entitled to form the government. But Zulfikar Bhutto refused to per-
mit Mujibur Rahman to become prime minister, or to accept Mujibur

Rahman’s Six Points. Bhutto also refused to take part in scheduled 
meetings in the National Assembly to frame a new constitution. Finally, 
in an effort to find a solution, Mujibur Rahman and Bhutto, along 
with Yahya Khan, met in Dhaka on March 3, 1971. They failed to find 
common ground. Mujibur Rahman immediately mounted a noncoop-
eration movement. The action paralyzed the government in the east. 
Public transportation was brought to a halt, and factories and busi-
nesses closed. Citizens withheld taxes. The Awami League established 
a shadow government to take the place of the state’s administrative 
apparatus. A provisional Awami League army, the Mukti Bahini, incited 
public protest and violence.

The floods that had devastated Bengal and caused the postpone-
ment of elections in the East Wing brought worldwide attention to the 
impoverished and backward region and helped foster the view in the 
international community that East Pakistan had suffered from the indif-
ference and rapacious policies of West Pakistan.

Seeking to defuse the growing crisis, General Yahya Khan announced 
the National Assembly would convene in Dhaka, East Pakistan, in 
March. In answer, Mujibur Rahman called for an immediate end to mar-
tial law and a transfer of power to newly elected representatives before 
the assembly convened as well as other demands. The demands led to 
the postponement of the meeting of the National Assembly. In its place 
the Awami League called for a Resistance Day to take place on March 
23, the Republic Day of Pakistan.

Yahya Khan traveled to Dhaka during this period, ostensibly to 
negotiate a resolution to the crisis with Mujibur Rahman and West 
Pakistani political leaders, but making no real effort to reach a politi-
cal settlement with the East Pakistani leadership. By then the excesses 
committed by the military against East Pakistani citizens under 
martial law had poisoned the atmosphere for a peaceful resolution. 
Without proclaiming the negotiations fruitless, Yahya Khan left Dhaka 
secretly on March 25, leaving orders for the armed forces to launch an 
offensive to restore order as soon as he arrived back in Karachi. That 
night Pakistani forces launched Operation Searchlight, a rampage 
through the East Wing. Thousands were killed, and Mujibur Rahman 
was arrested and taken to West Pakistan. The next day, March 26, an 
Awami League official announced that the East Wing was claiming 
independence under the name Bangladesh. This is now the nation’s 
Independence Day. Awami League militants took up arms, and on 
March 27 Yahya Khan sent in troops to put down the revolution. 
Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis were killed as a result of the

conflict, and some 10 million refugees fled to the neighboring Indian 
state of West Bengal.

In response to the refugee crisis India invaded the former East 
Pakistan to engage the Pakistani armed forces on November 21, 1971. 
Members of the Mukti Bahini allied themselves with the Indian forces 
against the Pakistani troops. Yahya Khan failed to appreciate the vigor 
with which India would try to take advantage of the instability, a 
weakness that contributed to his lackadaisical attitude toward finding 
a political solution to the crisis. Even before their full-scale invasion, 
Indian troops trained the Mukti Bahini and launched guerrilla raids 
into East Pakistan to take on Pakistani forces. Additionally, a military 
alliance treaty India concluded with the Soviet Union in August 1971 
gave the Indian armed forces greater power.

Pakistan’s army found itself in an unwinnable conflict from the 
beginning, but Yahya Khan made no effort to seek relief from the UN 
Security Council. Indian troops were advancing on Dhaka, but the 
Pakistani army had no defensive plan in place. The conflict spread to 
Kashmir, where Indian and Pakistani troops crossed the cease-fire line, 
and into West Pakistan itself as Indian troops invaded Punjab and Sind. 
With the situation deteriorating daily, on December 6, 1971, Yahya 
Khan resigned and appointed a civilian government. Nurul Amin, a 
prominent politician from Bengal and opponent of the Awami League, 
was named prime minister (r. Dec. 1971).

Later that December Bengali freedom fighters aided by Indian forces 
entered Dhaka, surrounding the main Pakistani forces under the com-
mand of General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi (1915–2004). While it was 
later determined the Pakistan army could have held out for at least two 
weeks, General Niazi chose to surrender. On December 17 a formal 
offer of surrender was agreed upon by the United Nations. Some 45,000 
troops from West Pakistan and a similar number of civilians from the 
west were taken as prisoners of war. The majority of the killings of civil-
ians by the Mukti Bahini occurred after the army’s surrender. So did a 
wave of discontent in what remained of Pakistan over the miscalcula-
tions and mismanagement of the civil war by its leaders.

BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 

(1971–1988)

The simultaneous loss of its East Wing and the defeat in its war with 
India was a devastating blow to Pakistan, leaving many citizens 

stunned and angry. The presidency of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, leader of the 
Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which replaced the discredited Yahya 
Khan regime, promised a peaceful, progressive period. But corrup-
tion charges and scandal ultimately led to widespread unrest, opening 
the door to another period of military rule. General Zia ul-Haq seized 
power in the name of restoring public order, suspended promised 
elections, and set the country on an Islamic course. It was during this 
period that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Pakistan became a 
key ally of the United States in a massive covert program to raise and 
equip an army of Islamic fighters to battle the Soviet forces. The ties 
forged between Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus and the mujahideen 
would have important consequences as the specter of global terrorism 
arose at the end of the century. The lives of the leaders during this tur-
bulent period came to violent ends. Bhutto’s ended with his hanging in 
1977 after a show trial. Zia ul-Haq was killed in a plane crash in 1987, 
an accident whose cause was never determined.

Zulfikar Bhutto’s Regime
Zulfikar Bhutto was at the United Nations to speak to the Security 
Council about the crisis in Bengal when Yahya Khan resigned on 
December 6, 1971. He returned to Pakistan on December 18 and on 
December 20 was named president (r. 1971–77) as well as the civilian 
chief martial law administrator.

With its East Wing gone, the rationale for Pakistan’s existence—a 
homeland for the subcontinent’s Muslims—seemed hollow. Pakistan 
had lost more than half of its population—70 million people—and more

than 54,000 square miles of its territory. While those in Bangladesh 
rejoiced at their independence, Pakistanis in the West Wing reacted in 
shock and anger, venting their rage at the armed forces and the govern-
ment. In one of his first official acts, Bhutto addressed the nation and 
vowed to rebuild Pakistan and restore its pride.

War Investigation
The same week he was named president, Bhutto convened a com-
mission to determine the causes of the military and political disaster 
Pakistan had suffered in Bengal, placing the chief justice of the Supreme 
Court, Hamoodur Rahman (served 1968–85), as head of the fact-finding 
body. More than 200 officials were interviewed, but the report, issued 
in July 1972, was classified and not made public. By this time Bhutto 
had been able to sway the public to accept recent events and welcome 
Bangladesh. At a mammoth public meeting in Karachi in February 
1972 he sought approval for releasing Mujibur Rahman, still in jail for 
agitating for now-realized Bengali independence, from prison.

In 1974 the investigation was reopened and a supplemental report 
issued, though this too remained classified for more than 25 years. 
In 2000 a copy of the initial and supplemental report appeared in the 
Indian press, and, with its contents unveiled, Pakistan authorized pub-
lication. The long-suppressed report included accounts of atrocities 
against West Pakistanis committed by militants from the Awami League, 
as well as by Bengali members of Pakistan’s armed forces against West 
Wing officers. When news of these atrocities reached West Pakistani 
troops during the war, they responded by committing atrocities of their 
own against Bengali officers and soldiers as well as civilian Bengalis 
and Hindus. The report also found the army guilty of mass killings of 
intellectuals and professionals and of the rape of large numbers of East 
Pakistani women. It recommended that the military officers deemed 
responsible for dereliction of duty be tried publicly.

The report concluded the military defeat was the result of systemic 
failures of political as well as military processes. A lack of courage 
among senior army commanders was identified as a key reason for the 
Pakistani army’s defeat. So too were the effects of martial law, which had 
corrupted the military by allowing officers to neglect military duties in 
favor of acquiring wealth and property under its cloak.

The number of casualties of the war is unknown, but it has been 
estimated at least 300,000—the majority of them Hindus, whom West 
Pakistanis believed were principally behind the independence move-
ment—died in the conflict.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

The Simla Agreement
In the immediate aftermath of the war, India held some 93,000 
Pakistani troops and civilians as prisoners of war. To win their release, 
Bhutto met Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi (r. 1966–77, 1980–84) 
at Simla, in northern India, in late June 1972 and agreed to recognize 
Bangladesh. India dropped plans to try some 200 soldiers accused of 
war crimes. The parties signed the Simla Agreement in early July, pledg-
ing to use peaceful means to settle differences between the two nations 
in the future. Both countries also agreed to pull back their troops in 
Jammu and Kashmir to their respective sides of the internationally rec-
ognized border and withdraw from other occupied territories seized in 
the war. India relinquished more than 5,000 square miles of Pakistani 
territory it held, and Pakistan relinquished about 70 square miles of 
Indian territory under its control. The agreement also stipulated the 
countries resume economic and diplomatic relations. Almost two years 
later, on February 22, 1974, Pakistan formally recognized Bangladesh, 
announced at the Islamic Conference in Lahore with the leaders of 
Islamic nations in attendance.

Bhutto’s Policies
Though he had championed restoration of democracy, Bhutto initially 
retained martial law. In March 1972 Bhutto gained effective control over 
the military by putting officers loyal to him in command of the army 
and air force. He pushed through an interim constitution that gave 
him expanded powers. He initially allowed formation of non-PPP-led 
governments in the areas of NWFP and Baluchistan, but within a few 
months dismissed these local governments, alleging foreign powers 
held undue influence over them. He also banned the National Awami 
Party, the primary voice of the political opposition.

Bhutto set the nation on a more economically socialist and politi-
cally nonaligned course. In an attempt to break up the concentration 
of wealth symbolized in the expression “22 families” in early 1972 
Bhutto nationalized 10 heavy industries, including steel, chemicals, 
and cement. In March he unveiled large-scale land reforms. Since 1959 
landholdings had been restricted to 500 acres for irrigated land and 
1,000 acres for nonirrigated land. To further break up large estates and 
make more land available to peasants, the Bhutto government limited 
ownership of agricultural land to a maximum of 150 acres for irrigated 
and 300 acres for nonirrigated land. Rights of tenant farmers were also 
strengthened.

BETWEEN EAST AND WEST

On the foreign-policy front Bhutto terminated Pakistan’s member-
ship in the Commonwealth of Nations and SEATO and recognized the 
Communist nations of East Germany, North Korea, and North Vietnam. 
Soon after taking office, he commenced a tour of 20 countries. The 
display of solidarity with international leaders bolstered the spirit of 
Pakistanis devastated by the civil war.

Bhutto pursued a policy of bilateralism, maintaining good relations 
with all nations by eschewing alliances with any. The policy’s purpose 
was to facilitate relations with the three competing major powers: 
China, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Early in 1972 he visited 
China and the Soviet Union; the United States, concerned about his 
policies of nationalization of private industries, was less welcoming to 
Bhutto when he visited in September 1973.

Now that Bengal was no longer part of Pakistan, Islamabad’s stand-
ing as the nation’s capital was unquestioned. When Bhutto summoned 
the members of the National Assembly to session in the spring of 1972, 
they met in Islamabad in a building borrowed from the State Bank of 
Pakistan. It was here that the constitution of 1973, the nation’s third, 
was created and voted into law.

Unrest in Baluchistan
Baluchistan, with its tradition of independence and aspirations for 
autonomy, was inspired by the birth of Bangladesh. The Baluchi tribes, 
spread across Central Asia, had been separated by international borders 
in the 19th century when boundaries between Iran, Afghanistan, and 
British India were established, disrupting their nomadic life and cul-
ture. A large portion of Pakistan’s mineral and energy resources were 
located in Baluchistan, but the local population, among the poorest 
in Pakistan, benefited little from the wealth of natural resources. The 
Baluchi were unhappy with the growing number of miners, traders, and 
settlers, mostly from Punjab, migrating to Baluchistan to explore these 
resources. The frustration and anger erupted in an insurgency in 1973 
led by the Baluch People’s Liberation Organization. Many of the most 
committed nationalists had communist leanings and considered seek-
ing protection from the Soviet Union to guarantee the security of the 
independent Baluchistan they envisioned. The core of the insurgency 
was small, but as the conflict wore on, the appeal of its message grew.

Pakistan’s government and military were still reeling from the 
loss of Bangladesh. The officer corps was in disarray and the troops 
ill-equipped, and the political leadership unsure of its direction.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Afghanistan was a close ally of India, and India was ruled by the reso-
lute and implacable Indira Gandhi. Bhutto and others were concerned 
the Baluchi nationalists might receive support from the Afghan, Indian, 
or Soviet governments.

The shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (r. 1941–79), eager to 
keep the insurgency from spreading to Baluchis in Iran, reportedly 
promised that should India give them assistance, the Iranian army 
would battle alongside Pakistani troops in Baluchistan. With the pledge 
of help from Iran, Bhutto used harsh methods to suppress the insurrec-
tion. The Pakistan army waged full-scale warfare against the insurgents, 
deploying Huey-Cobra helicopter gunships supplied and flown by the 
Iranians.

Bhutto gained public support for the war. Punjabis, who were targets 
of the insurgents’ hostility, backed Bhutto. The threat of loss of another 
major piece of the nation, so soon after the loss of the East Wing, also 
helped solidify public backing. Western governments feared an inde-
pendent Baluchistan allied with Moscow would give the Soviet Union 
its long-sought warm-water port, Baluchistan’s port of Gwadar. The 
Soviet Union, which saw Bhutto as a friendly leader, did not want to 
alienate a potentially important client state. Afghanistan seemed eager 
to normalize relations with Pakistan and so refrained from supporting 
the Baluchi cause. And India did not want to see further fragmentation 
of the subcontinent and the instability that could accompany it. Bhutto’s 
harsh methods ultimately quelled the opposition. Many involved in the 
movement sought sanctuary in Afghanistan and the Soviet Union as 
well as in the United Kingdom and France. But the insurrection did not 
end until 1977, after Bhutto had been removed from office. The regime 
of General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq, which deposed Bhutto’s, used eco-
nomic inducements to win the hearts and minds of the Baluchis and 
tamp down secessionist aspirations.

The Constitution of 1973
Bhutto oversaw the drafting of the nation’s third constitution, accom-
plished with the cooperation of opposition parties, and was able to 
reach consensus on the fractious issues of provincial autonomy, Islam’s 
place in government, and the nature of the federal government. The 
constitution declared the nation to be a federal republic; it continued 
to be known as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. In place of the One 
Unit system that had been adopted in part to mollify East Pakistan, 
the nation was to have four provinces: Punjab, Sind, NWFP, and

Baluchistan. Islam was declared the state religion. The government 
would be a bicameral parliamentary system consisting of the National 
Assembly and the Senate. Members of these bodies would choose the 
president, who would serve a five-year term and be limited to two 
terms. The president would appoint a governor for each province and 
also appoint the attorney general, supreme and high court judges, and 
the chief election commissioner. The prime minister would appoint 
federal ministers from among members of Parliament. The constitution 
guaranteed citizens fundamental rights of life, liberty, equality, freedom 
of speech, and freedom of association. Unlike the previous constitution, 
which gave the president absolute power, this version made the prime 
minister the key power. It placed the military under civilian authority 
in an effort to prevent coups, which had previously brought military 
rulers to the presidency.

The constitution of 1973 was also more Islamic in nature than the 
two previous constitutions had been. It created an Islamic advisory 
council, the Council of Islamic Ideology, to ensure all laws were in 
keeping with the tenets of Islam. as had the constitution of 1962. 
However, it also mandated the government take further steps to pro-
mote Islam. These included making the teaching of the Qur’an compul-
sory in schools; making the government responsible for organizing the 
collection of zakat, or charitable donations, which Islam requires; and 
making the state responsible for preventing gambling and prostitution, 
which the religion forbids.

The constitution took effect on August 14, 1973, Pakistan’s 26th 
anniversary. The passage of the new constitution was followed by elec-
tions in the legislative bodies for president, prime minister, and other 
key leadership posts. Bhutto resigned as president, and members of the 
National Assembly and the Senate elected him prime minister. He was 
sworn into office on August 14, 1973. Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry was elected 
president (r. 1973–78). Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry wielded no real power, as 
the constitution vested almost all authority in the prime minister.

Growing Repression
Pakistan appeared to be back on a democratic course. But Bhutto con-
tinued to use the powers of his office to undermine and battle the oppo-
sition on any disagreement. Amendments to the constitution adopted 
during his rule reflected the changing tenor of the Bhutto regime. The 
first recognized Bangladesh, following an accord on mutual recognition 
reached between the countries in early 1974; formal diplomatic relations

would not be established until two years later. A second amendment 
was passed to win favor from religious parties. That amendment was 
adopted when a battle over the Ahmadiyya movement resurfaced in the 
fall of 1974. Seeking to bolster his credentials with the religious estab-
lishment, Bhutto issued a resolution passed by the National Assembly 
proclaiming the Ahmadiyya to be a non-Muslim sect. Legislation was 
later adopted that made it illegal for Ahmadiyya to call themselves 
Muslims or use Muslim terminology in reference to their faith. They 
were not, for example, allowed to call their place of worship a mosque. 
A third amendment adopted limited the rights of detainees, and a 
fourth, in 1976, curtailed the rights of political opponents of the ruling 
party as Bhutto’s rule became increasingly autocratic.

Reluctant to use the military in his politics of repression, given the 
armed forces’ history of coups, Bhutto created the Federal Security 
Force (FSF), a paramilitary police corps. Drawing on retired military 
officers and senior police personnel, the force worked closely with the 
staff of the prime minister. At first deployed to maintain law and order 
in situations beyond the capabilities of the police, in time the security 
force was used for gathering political intelligence and allegedly disrupt-
ing the activities of political opposition groups.

A Socialist Economy
For all the efforts of Ayub Khan’s economic development plans in the 
early 1960s, by the end of his regime real wages had declined, poverty 
increased, and income was concentrated in the hands of a burgeoning 
industrial elite. At the time Bhutto took office, Pakistan was operating at 
a deficit, importing far more than it exported. The loss of East Pakistan 
added to the challenge facing the country’s economy. To redress Pakistan’s 
international trade imbalance, Bhutto’s government devalued the rupee by 
more than half—58 percent—in relation to the U.S. dollar soon after com-
ing to power. Pakistani goods became cheaper on the international mar-
ket, and imported goods cost more. But devaluation also made paying off 
debts to international banks more expensive, and it stimulated inflation.

Zulfikar Bhutto’s economic policies reflected his populist platform, 
an approach he called “Islamic socialism.” More socialist than Islamic, it 
included land and labor reform initiatives, nationalization of industries 
and major business sectors, and efforts to alleviate economic inequities 
and improve social services. But draping the economic policy under 
the mantle of Islam minimized attacks from rightists who objected 
to socialism. Moreover, the message was malleable: Islam could be

stressed to religious constituencies, socialism to industrial workers, 
and land reform to Sind’s rural lower classes. Bhutto also saw the policy 
as similar to those practiced in Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, and Syria, which 
he admired. Bhutto’s blend helped win support across a spectrum of 
classes and interest groups.

Carrying through on his nationalization agenda, in 1972 the govern-
ment took control of more than 31 large companies in 10 basic indus-
tries: iron and steel, basic metals, heavy engineering, motor vehicle 
assembly and manufacture, tractor assembly and manufacture, heavy 
and basic chemicals, petrochemicals, cement and public utilities. The 
nationalization was undertaken in part to reduce the hold Pakistan’s 
22 wealthiest families, who controlled these industries, had on the 
country’s economy and political power. Banks were also nationalized, 
as were 32 life insurance companies. Credit policies for small farmers 
and small businesses and entrepreneurs were eased.

That same year Bhutto lowered the maximum limit on individual 
ownership of land from about 500 irrigated to 150 irrigated acres,

and from about 1,000 to 300 unirrigated acres. However, loopholes 
enabled many landowners, including the Bhutto family, among the 
largest landowners in Sind, to retain their lands. Laws governing 
the landlord-tenant relationship were amended to prevent evictions 
and outlaw free labor. The rights of workers and trade unions were 
strengthened.

required signifi cant public investment, which created a drag on the economy. (Courtesy

Bhutto also introduced educational reforms, making education 
through high school free and providing allowances to unemployed 
college graduates. He also mandated admission quotas to public uni-
versities, ensuring that students from rural areas had access to college 
degrees.

Higher oil prices following OPEC’s 1973 oil embargo, along with 
natural disasters including floods and an earthquake, also impacted the 
economy during Bhutto’s rule. The floods affected crops and boosted 
prices, and in response the cotton and rice export trade were national-
ized. Flour-, rice-, and cotton-processing businesses were nationalized 
in 1976.

Owing to nationalization, the role of the public sector in the econ-
omy increased dramatically. In 1972 the public sector contributed 3 
percent to the nation’s output. By 1976 the figure rose to 13 percent, 
and a full 20 percent of nonagricultural output. The costs of nation-
alization, which included large investments in acquired industries 
and businesses, financed with international loans, quickly became a 
drag on the economy. By 1974 Pakistan was unable to make its debt 
payments on the loans, commencing ongoing payment rescheduling 
efforts by Pakistan over the next several years. This basic restructuring 
also caused widespread economic dislocation. Many left the country 
to look for work in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States. 
Remittances sent back to Pakistan from these émigrés helped bolster 
the country’s economy during the Bhutto years.

The government experienced perennial budget deficits during 
Bhutto’s rule. To finance them, money was printed, adding to infla-
tionary pressures. The economic results of nationalization and of the 
investments made in formerly private enterprises are difficult to deter-
mine. In some cases investments made in these industries, for example 
in fertilizer and cement production, during the Bhutto regime did not 
begin to pay off until Zia ul-Haq’s regime.

Overall the economy under his stewardship was characterized by 
stagnation. Industrial output increased only 2.1 percent annually, 
and agricultural output 2.3 percent annually during Bhutto’s years in 
power.

The Elections of 1977
As Bhutto’s rule continued, his authoritarian manner and efforts to sup-
press political opposition eroded public support. Charges of corruption 
and mismanagement grew, fueled by the country’s imploding economy

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

and rising level of inflation. Bhutto was also held responsible by some 
for having caused the crisis that led to the loss of East Pakistan. By 1977 
the middle class was disillusioned with the Bhutto regime. General 
elections were scheduled to be held in the latter half of 1977, but in 
January Bhutto announced the dates for the election would be moved 
up. A week later, the chief election commissioner announced that all 
nominations for the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies 
had to be filed by January 19 and 22, respectively. Bhutto expected the 
opposition would be unprepared, and, indeed, the accelerated timetable 
hampered the ability of the opposition to field candidates as well as 
to register them. Bhutto immediately plunged into campaigning, ally-
ing himself not only with the disadvantaged, who had been the core 
strength of the PPP, but also with feudal lords. To bolster his support 
among the commoners, Bhutto announced new land reforms.

Rather than battle Bhutto and his party individually, nine opposi-
tion parties united under the banner of the Pakistan National Alliance 
(PNA). They campaigned on an anti-Bhutto platform, charging him 
with corruption and mismanagement while simultaneously claiming 
the Qur’an, the Muslim holy book, as their political as well as spiritual 
inspiration. The PNA generated surprisingly large support during the 
campaign. The political establishment, which was increasingly unpopu-
lar, displayed overt anti-PNA bias, enhancing the party’s appeal among 
large numbers of voters. Public PNA rallies drew immense crowds. But 
in the elections for the National Assembly, held on March 7, Bhutto’s 
PPP took the majority of seats and the PNA won only 36, a surpris-
ingly poor showing given the crowds the PNA had drawn during the 
campaign. The PNA protested, claiming widespread election fraud and 
intimidation, and demanded new elections to be held under the supervi-
sion of the armed forces. The PNA also boycotted the provincial assem-
bly elections. The resounding victory of the PPP in these elections—in 
some areas winning more votes than there were voters—bolstered the 
charges of corruption leveled by the PPP’s opponents.

Bhutto rejected demands for new elections, and in response the PNA 
called for nationwide strikes and protests, which had the support of 
religious and business groups. Bhutto met the opposition with defi-
ance. PNA leaders were jailed and martial law was declared in Karachi, 
Lahore, and Hyderabad, while major cities throughout the country 
were put under curfew. In May and June battles between PNA sup-
porters and government security forces became particularly violent. 
Bhutto’s repressive tactics failed to end the standoff. He shifted to a 
more conciliatory tone and had some of the PNA’s leaders released 

212

from jail, initiating negotiations with them in June. Bhutto offered to 
hold new elections in November and promised the PNA five ministerial 
positions for their party until then. But the PNA demanded half of all 
cabinet positions and that elections be held before mid-August. Bhutto 
finally agreed to meet almost all the PNA’s terms, but before formal-
izing the agreement he left Pakistan for a tour of Saudi Arabia, Libya, 
the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Iran. His opponents viewed the 
trip as a delaying tactic.

Zia ul-Haq’s Coup d’État
The army was called in to restore order in major cities. With the 
impasse threatening to incite anarchy across the country, on July 5, 
1977, General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq (1924–88) arrested Bhutto and 
members of his cabinet and imposed martial law. The constitution was 
suspended and all legislative bodies dissolved. It was the country’s third 
military coup.

Muhammad Zia ul-Haq was born to a middle-class family in East 
Punjab in 1924. Schooled in India and a veteran of the British Indian 
Army, where he attended officer-training school, he chose to join the 
Pakistani army upon partition. He 
later trained in the United States 
and, while working his way up 
to the rank of lieutenant gen-
eral, developed a reputation as 
a professional soldier with little 
interest in politics. Furthermore, 
he had little affinity with most 
other high-level officers, many 
of whom came from northern 
areas of Pakistan, which had been 
favored recruiting grounds for the 
British. Given the history of mili-
tary interference with civilian rule, 
Bhutto had been cognizant of the 
potential threat represented by the 
armed forces and had chosen Zia 
ul-Haq as army chief of staff in General Zia ul-Haq seized power from

was suspended rather than abrogated. Zia announced that elections, 
overseen by the military, would be held within 90 days under “Operation 
Fairplay,” but this pledge went unfulfilled. He disbanded the FSF, Bhutto’s 
security force, and established a committee to investigate irregularities in 
the election.

Bhutto’s End
Zulfikar Bhutto was released from detention on July 29, 1977, little less 
than a month after his arrest. Though removed from office, Bhutto was 
initially allowed to remain in politics. He embarked on a series of politi-
cal rallies across Pakistan and proclaimed that those responsible for the 
military takeover would face legal consequences once he was restored 
to power. The constitution of 1973 made a coup d’état a capital offense 
punishable by death, and Bhutto left no doubt of his intention to seek 
such redress. Thus, the military was reluctant to allow him the chance 
to regain power.

The committee investigating the election irregularities reported find-
ing a document in Bhutto’s home, prepared in 1976, that it described 
as a blueprint for election fraud. Entitled “A Model Election Plan,” it 
became known as the “Larkana Plan.” The chief election commissioner 
later blamed the PPP candidates for using the power of their offices to 
circumvent election laws.

In early September 1977 Bhutto was rearrested and, though briefly 
released, was eventually brought to trial on charges that included con-
spiracy to murder a political opponent. The director-general of the FSF, 
Masood Mahmood (served ca. 1972–77) was implicated in the murder 
and pleaded guilty. His deposition formed the bulk of the case against 
Bhutto. The trial began in October and lasted into the new year. Much 
of the evidence presented seemed questionable and the witnesses for 
the prosecution unreliable. Nonetheless, in March 1978 the Lahore 
high court found Bhutto guilty and sentenced him to death. An appeal 
was rejected by the Supreme Court in early 1979, and on April 4 Bhutto 
was hanged in Rawalpindi’s central jail.

By the time of his execution Bhutto had ceased to be a factor in 
Pakistani politics. In February 1978 political leaders had gathered for 
a conference to discuss restoration of civilian rule and democracy. But 
Zia had no intention of giving up his rule. In September, as Bhutto 
faced trial, Zia had taken the title of president (r. 1978–88) and made 
the martial law administrator of each province its governor. He was the 
nation’s sixth president, and the third to assume the office in the after-

math of staging a military coup. In early 1979 Zia disbanded political 
parties and disenfranchised some politicians.

While Bhutto had been vanquished, his party, the PPP, had not. 
Bhutto’s oldest child, Benazir Bhutto (1953–2007), became its leader. Zia 
and his regime set out to neutralize the party’s power and to restructure 
the political process to ensure the PPP’s impotence. From 1979 to 1985 
Zia engaged in numerous maneuvers to achieve this objective, from stra-
tegic alliances with PPP opponents to cancellation of elections.

Zia’s rule was marked by economic growth in the private sec-
tor and the growing influence of Islamic parties on the government. 
Responsibility for the economy was turned over to Ghulam Ishaq 
Khan (1915–2006). Pakistan had been without a coherent economic 
strategy since the early 1970s. The five-year plan in place at that time 
was shelved, made irrelevant after East Pakistan’s secession. Zulfikar 
Bhutto’s restructuring of the economy was conducted without a road 
map. It was not until July 1, 1978, that the next and Fifth Five-Year 
Plan (1978–83) was instituted, one year into Zia ul-Haq’s imposition 
of martial law. The plan’s stated goal was improving the reach and 
quality of social services. With the budget stretched by investments in 
the public sector, the new plan curtailed industrial and infrastructure 
expansion, focusing its spending on works in progress. However, devel-
opment funds were also earmarked for agricultural projects, including 
investments in water resources and loans and subsidies for farmers. 
Economic planners were counting on a healthy return on investment. 
During the first five years of the 1970s Pakistan’s GDP had increased 4.1 
percent annually. The fifth plan called for a 7.0 percent annual growth 
in GDP, fueled by a projected 10 percent annual increase in industrial 
growth and 6 percent increase in agricultural output. The plan also pro-
vided a blueprint and timetable for bringing the economic and financial 
sectors of the country in line with Islamic principles.

Relations with the United States improved during Zia’s rule as well. 
The Iranian Revolution had brought a virulently anti-U.S. Shi’i regime 
to power in Tehran, and the United States needed friends in the region. 
Pakistan, dominated by Sunnis, also saw a threat across the border in 
Iran. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 was another 
catalyst for the suddenly strong relationship.

Pakistan and Islam
Since the republic’s inception, the role of Islam in the government had 
been hotly debated. Pakistan was founded as a parliamentary democracy, 

215

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

with Islam as the state religion, although the constitution allowed free-
dom of religion to the members of other faiths. Jinnah, the father of 
the nation, wanted separation from the subcontinent’s Hindu majority 
not because he thought Pakistan should be a theocracy but because he 
saw it as a refuge where Muslims could be free to pursue their religion 
as they wished. Zia, however, tried to bolster the influence of Islamic 
parties and the ulama on government and society. With the tacit sup-
port of the United States, which sought to undermine the Soviet regime 
in Afghanistan, he encouraged the formation and activities of militant 
extremist groups.

In his first speech to the nation, Zia pledged the government would 
work to create a true Islamic society. A federal sharia council, or reli-
gious law court, was created to determine cases based on the teachings 
of the Qur’an and the Sunna, the book of traditions of the Prophet’s 
sayings and deeds from which much of Islamic law is derived. A sharia 
council was appointed to bring the state’s legal statutes into alignment 
with Islamic doctrine. To address the Islamic prohibition against charg-
ing or paying interest, or riba, a system of profit-and-loss sharing was 
instituted on January 1, 1980, whereby account holders would share in 
their banks’ profits and losses. Efforts to enforce the Islamic tenets of 
praying five times each day were adopted, and public eating and drink-
ing during the holy month of Ramadan was outlawed.

The general also introduced the Islamic hadood into Pakistani law, which 
deals with the drinking and manufacturing of alcohol, theft, adultery, false 
accusations of adultery, and highway robbery. The Hadood Ordinance 
passed into law by Zia in February 1979 stipulated that punishments for 
crimes would be consistent with those called for under traditional Islamic 
jurisprudence, including floggings, amputations, and death by stoning. 
Women were particularly vulnerable under the third ordinance, as a 
woman who became pregnant as the result of rape could be charged with 
adultery. Furthermore, a woman’s testimony was deemed only half as reli-
able as that of a man. Thus, the testimony of two women was required to 
rebut the testimony of one man under the revised legal code.

Islamic scholars were retained to devise laws pertaining to financing 
and the economy that would incorporate Islamic principles. The Zakat 
and Ushr Ordinance that resulted was adopted in June 1980. Zakat, or 
alms for the poor, would be deducted at the rate of 2.5 percent per year 
from all Muslims’ bank accounts holding more than 3,000 rupees. For 
those who held land or cultivated crops, ushr in cash or crops would 
be levied at 10 percent of the land’s yield. Zakat committees were estab-
lished to oversee the distribution of the collected funds.

BETWEEN EAST AND WEST

In 1986 the penalty for blasphemy against the prophet Muhammad 
was raised from life in prison to death. Islamic studies and Arabic became 
compulsory courses for many degree programs. The media was directed 
to present the news in Arabic on both television and radio, and female 
announcers were required to cover their heads. In the armed forces, reli-
gious teachers were elevated to the rank of commissioned officers.

However, the country’s citizens began to chafe and protest at the 
increasing Islamization of their nation, and Zia had to stop short of 
adopting sharia as the law of the land; with their limited jurisdiction the 
sharia courts had primarily affected Muslim personal law and religious 
issues. Yet with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Islam was seen as 
being threatened by infidel forces just across the border, giving added 
power to the general’s call for governing Pakistan on Islamic ideals.

Nuclear Program
In May 1974 India became a nuclear power when it detonated a nuclear 
device underground with an estimated yield of 15 kilotons. Although 
India claimed that it did not have plans for nuclear weapons, the devel-
opment was profoundly disturbing to Pakistan. After India’s nuclear 
test, Pakistan proposed to India that South Asia be declared a nuclear 
weapons–free zone, but India declined. As the minister of power, fuel, 
and natural resources, Zulfikar Bhutto instituted a nuclear weapons 
development program in response.

Pakistan had had a research reactor in operation at Parr, in Rawalpindi, 
since 1965, and its nuclear ambitions—or at least consideration of its 
options—preceded Bhutto’s tenure. When the United Nation’s Treaty 
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, created to staunch the 
spread of nuclear weapons, was completed in 1968, Pakistan declined 
to become a signatory, as did India and China.

Pakistan was the beneficiary of aid from the United States through 
the United States’s Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. In an effort to put 
pressure on Pakistan to stop its nuclear weapons program, the U.S. 
Congress passed the first of several amendments to the act that prohib-
ited assistance to countries for weapons development. The Symington 
Amendment, passed in 1976, banned assistance to any country traffick-
ing in nuclear-enrichment technology outside of international controls. 
In 1979 Pakistan was found in violation of the Symington Amendment 
by U.S. president Jimmy Carter (r. 1977–81) for clandestinely building 
a uranium-enrichment plant. U.S. assistance was cut off. The sanctions 
had little impact in stopping the program. A 1983 U.S. government

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

assessment concluded there was unambiguous evidence that Pakistan 
was actively pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. The U.S. Congress 
passed the Pressler Amendment in 1985, requiring that before Pakistan 
could receive aid, the president had to certify annually that Pakistan 
had no nuclear device. However, the president was given the power to 
waive sanctions when such action was perceived to be in the nation’s 
interest. In fact, soon after assistance to Pakistan was cut off in 1979, 
regional events would prove to Pakistan that the United States could 
quickly change its priorities and policies.

Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan
In late December 1979 Leonid Brezhnev (r. 1964–82), general secre-
tary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the country’s de 
facto leader, ordered Soviet forces to invade Afghanistan in support 
of the Soviet-allied regime of Hafizullah Amin (r. Sept.–Dec. 1979), 
whose government was under attack from tribal resistance groups. 
The invasion was supposed to be a quick surgical operation aimed at 
securing Kabul, the Afghan capital, and primary communication lines 
linking the country and the Soviet Union. But the Soviets wanted an 
even more compliant leader and on December 28 had Amin assassi-
nated. Babrak Karmal (r. 1979–86), a Soviet protégé and puppet, was 
installed as president.

In response to the invasion President Carter canceled U.S. partici-
pation in the 1980 Summer Olympics, held in Moscow; put the SALT 
(Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) II missile treaty on hold; and reduced 
contracted shipments of grain to the Soviet Union. However, caught 
up in the Iranian hostage crisis, he was unable to take more decisive 
steps. Six months prior Carter had signed a secret directive authoriz-
ing assistance to the rebels fighting the Communist government in 
Afghanistan. After the Soviet invasion the United States encouraged 
Muslim countries around the world to help with propaganda and 
covert aid against the Soviets in Afghanistan. The goal was to harness 
the religious fervor of Muslims who viewed the battle as a holy war 
against invading infidels.

Pakistan became a major ally of the United States as money and 
matériel were routed through Pakistan to support the mujahideen, 
or holy warriors, who were organized to battle the infidel invaders. 
Pakistan, for its support of U.S. efforts, received most-favored-nation 
trading status. At the same time some 4 million Afghan war refugees 
fled into Baluchistan and the NWFP. Pakistan’s primary intelligence

agency, the Directorate for Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI), served as 
liaison between the Pakistani and U.S. governments and the mujahi-
deen. Founded in 1948, the ISI’s role was expanded under Ayub Khan’s 
rule in the 1950s, when agents were employed in monitoring opposi-
tion politicians and supporting the country’s martial-law rule.

In 1988 U.S. president Ronald Reagan (r. 1981–89), elected in 
November 1980, waived the aid sanctions imposed on Pakistan under 
the Symington Amendment. The assistance from the United States 
helped Pakistan’s economy, removing the financial problems that had 
beset earlier regimes. The Pakistani army was also able to modernize 
with a $3.2 billion military-assistance package and U.S.-supplied weap-
ons and training.

Training camps established in Pakistan and Afghanistan trained as 
many as 100,000 Muslims from dozens of countries. These mujahideen 
turned Afghanistan into what became known as the Soviet Union’s 
Vietnam, leaving 15,000 Soviets dead and 37,000 wounded by 1989. 
More than 1 million Afghans died in the war, and 5 million became 
refugees. After a decade the Soviet Union could no longer afford to con-
tinue its losing war in Afghanistan. Negotiations for a withdrawal were 
conducted under General Zia’s auspices, and the agreement ending the 
conflict, the Geneva Accords, was signed on April 14, 1988. The Soviets 
withdrew in 1989, leaving behind a shaky Communist regime barely in 
control of Kabul. When the government in Kabul fell in April 1992, it 
was regarded by the mujahideen as a grand victory for Islam, and by the 
West as a major defeat for communism.

But the impact of the war continued to reverberate across Pakistan. 
Pakistan was beset by the drug trafficking and gunrunning that had 
helped fund the resistance to the Soviet occupation. Meanwhile, the 
freedom fighters in Afghanistan turned on each other, transform-
ing the country into a lawless land. Ultimately the Taliban, Islamic 
fundamentalists, gained control of the country, making it a haven for 
militant Islamists.

Effects of the War in Baluchistan and NWFP
The influx of Afghan refugees across the border into Baluchistan and 
NWFP added another destabilizing element to an already volatile 
territory. Both regions had joined Pakistan for the promise of eco-
nomic benefit and in the name of Muslim solidarity but had come to 
feel shortchanged by the arrangement. One source of disaffection in 
Baluchistan was the inequitable sharing of revenues and benefits from

the province’s natural resources. Natural gas, for example, discovered in 
the province in 1953, was fueling cities in Punjab by 1964. But at the 
time of the Soviet invasion, there was still no pipeline to the Baluchi 
capital, Quetta, and it would not reach the city until 1986—brought 
in to supply a military garrison. Moreover, the federal government had 
long stressed the need for national unity over ethnic identity, and both 
Baluchis and Pashtun, with their strong cultural roots and tradition of 
independence, felt the brunt of this policy.

With more than 40 percent of Pakistan’s land but only 5 percent of 
its population, most of them rural poor, the government saw little need 
to placate Baluchistan’s population. The Baluchis represent a plural-
ity but not majority of its inhabitants; Baluchis compose 45 percent, 
and Pashtun 38 percent, with the rest of the population of mixed or 
indeterminate ancestry. Though their plurality may be small, Baluchis 
regard themselves as the dominant power in the province. In NWFP, 
the Pashtun also agitated for more autonomy, with some calling for an 
independent Pashtun nation. Ongoing negligence of the provinces by 
Islamabad fueled the discontent.

The local population supported the war, however, and believed in 
the jihad against the Soviets. The ISI, Pakistan’s intelligence agency, 
served as the conduit for the support to the mujahideen paid for by 
the CIA and Saudi Arabia, the two primary underwriters of the war 
against the Soviets. Though Zia ul-Haq, who endorsed and approved 
the anti-Soviet jihad, was head of the armed forces, he left direction of 
the Afghanistan campaign to the ISI. The ISI established camps where 
mujahideen volunteers trained, and the agency handled all logistical 
elements of funneling material to the Muslim warlords on the front 
lines. During this period the ISI, which had been discredited for intel-
ligence lapses during Bangladesh’s war of independence, regained its 
stature and power.

But the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan exacerbated conflicts 
between the Baluchis and Pashtun. Since the 1980s, more than 2 mil-
lion Afghan refugees, most of them Pashtun, resettled in Pakistan, 
one-quarter of them in Baluchistan. The tide of Afghans fleeing over 
the border into Baluchistan led to charges by Baluchis that they were 
becoming minorities in their own homeland. Concurrently, with the 
Pashtun population swelled in the NWFP by the refugees, calls for 
Pashtun autonomy in the region became louder.

Ethnic tensions continued to build in Baluchistan. In October 1992 
clashes between Baluchis and Pashtun erupted, sparked by the creation of

12 new wards in the municipality of Quetta. The Pashtun saw the change 
as an effort to reduce their representation and aid Baluchis in winning 
local elections. Baluchi disaffection with the federal government con-
tinued as well. In 1998 three Baluchis hijacked a Pakistan International 
Airlines (PIA) aircraft to draw attention to what they claimed was the 
discrimination of Baluchis by Pakistan and to protest what they believed 
were planned tests of nuclear weapons in Baluchistan.

Restoration of Civilian Rule
In 1980, with the National Assembly dissolved, Zia created a Majlis-
i-Shoora, a council of handpicked advisers, to provide counsel and 
an appearance of communal rule. The council included intellectu-
als, religious scholars, and professionals. Still, calls rose for an end 
to martial law and elections. In February 1981 the Movement for 
Restoration of Democracy (MRD) was founded. In March the govern-
ment established a provisional constitution to replace the constitution 
of 1973, which had been abrogated by the martial law imposed at the 
time of Zia’s coup.

General Zia sought a way to restore civilian rule while retaining the 
presidency. Under the Referendum Order of 1984 Zia scheduled a vote 
on the country’s future through which he sought backdoor approval 
for his continued rule. The referendum asked voters if they approved 
of the Islamization process Zia had initiated and if they wanted an 
orderly transfer of power to elected representatives. Zia considered a 
yes answer to be the equivalent of a vote for his retention as president 
for five years. The referendum was held on December 19, 1984. Though 
boycotted by the MRD, General Zia claimed the results validated his 
continuing rule as president. He then announced that elections for 
national and provincial assemblies would be held in February 1985, 
although candidates would run as individuals, not as representatives of 
any political party.

While the MRD boycotted the elections, the public voted in large 
numbers. Since many known political opponents were off the ballot 
because of their boycott, many obscure representatives were elected. 
This gave the elections a veneer of democracy without Zia having to 
contend with established opponents in the newly elected national and 
provincial assemblies.

Following the election Zia nominated Muhammad Khan Junejo 
(r. 1985–88) as prime minister. Junejo lifted martial law and restored

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

the constitution after extensive amendments were adopted at the behest 
of Zia that gave the prime minister little maneuvering room. Whereas 
the constitution of 1973 had vested most of the power in the office 
of the prime minister, Zia’s constitutional changes greatly changed 
the power equation, elevating the president’s position on a par with 
that of the prime minister. In November 1985 the Senate adopted the 
Eighth Amendment to the constitution. It gave the president the right 
to nominate the prime minister, provincial governors, and judges of 
the supreme and high court. The amendment allowed the president to 
call referenda on national issues, establish the legislative agenda, and 
order the prime minister to seek a vote of confidence from the National 
Assembly. Article 58 2(b), gave the president the right to dissolve the 
National Assembly at his sole discretion. Thus the government went 
from a parliamentary to a federal system.

SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION 
FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 

(SAARC)

In 1980 the president of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman (r. 1977–81), 
proposed creating a regional alliance in South Asia to promote 

greater cooperation among member states and regional peace, stabil-
ity, and economic development. Representatives of regional states 
met in 1983 to consider the idea more thoroughly and decided to 
proceed. In December 1985 the South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation (SAARC) was launched. The seven member states were 
Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. 
Members pledged that all action would be endorsed unanimously. 
Since then the summit conferences have provided a venue for lead-
ers of these nations to discuss issues on social, economic, cultural, 
and other policies. A permanent secretariat’s offi ce is maintained in 
Kathmandu, Nepal. Though it has fostered improved regional rela-
tions, it has proven less successful as a forum for resolving diffi cult 
bilateral regional issues, such as resolution of the Kashmiri confl ict. 
India has consistently declined to endorse calls for using the SAARC 
for this purpose, as proposed by Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. As 
unanimity is required for actions, without India’s approval the pro-
posal cannot advance.

BETWEEN EAST AND WEST

Zia’s supporters claimed that previous political deadlocks had 
made the imposition of martial law imperative. Bestowing the power 
to dissolve the assembly upon the president would ensure such 
deadlocks would never end in a military takeover again, because the 
president could now simply dismiss the assembly in the event of such 
a crisis.

Junejo, despite his diluted power, fulfilled his promises, returning 
basic freedoms to Pakistanis. In December 1985 Junejo unveiled an 
ambitious five-point program to set the government and society on a 
more progressive and egalitarian course. The objectives included eco-
nomic reforms, social justice, ending corruption, and cutting illiteracy 
in half. Under the initiative, in rural areas roads were built and villages 
received electricity.

Unafraid to antagonize powerful interests, Junejo pursued a for-
eign policy developed with input from leaders across the spectrum of 
Pakistani politics. After martial law was lifted, generals who had grown 
accustomed to luxurious perks found their large staff cars replaced 
by small vehicles. In April 1988, at Ojheri Camp military base near 
Islamabad, an explosion at a weapons storage facility sent rockets rain-
ing down on the city, killing hundreds of civilians. Junejo attempted 
to investigate the incident, which further inflamed military leaders. 
He was returning from a visit to South Korea on May 29, 1988, when 
President Zia dismissed Junejo, his government, and the national and 
provincial assemblies, using Article 58 2(b) of the constitution to jus-
tify his action. Zia claimed a breakdown in law and order had left the 
government unable to conduct business. General Zia installed a care-
taker government and promised elections in 90 days.

Zia’s Death
On August 17, 1988, Zia, along with his military secretary, Najib 
Ahmed; ISI director Akhtar Abdur Rahman; the leadership of the army 
and other Pakistani officials; as well as the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, 
Arnold Raphel (served 1987–88), went to Bhawalpur in Punjab to view 
a demonstration of tank maneuvers. On the return flight to Islamabad, 
the C-130 military transport they were aboard crashed shortly after 
takeoff, killing all 30 people on the aircraft. The cause of the crash was 
never identified, but suggestions of sabotage were raised. The report of 
the official inquiry was never released.

Political leaders gathered in Islamabad to determine how to deal 
with succession. The constitution stipulated that in the event of death,

incapacitation, resignation, or removal of the president, the chairman 
of the Senate, a position held by Ghulam Ishaq Khan (1915–2006), 
was to take the position until a new president was elected. Military and 
civilian leaders agreed to proceed as constitutionally mandated. Thus 
Ishaq Khan assumed the presidency on August 17, 1988, an office he 
would hold until July 1993.

CIVILIAN RULE RESTORED 

(1988–1999)

General Zia ul-Haq’s unexpected death in 1988 brought about a 
return to civilian rule in Pakistan. Over the next decade a series 

of leaders struggled to establish firm control over the government. Two 
rivals came to dominate the political landscape during this period: 
Benazir Bhutto (1953–2007), daughter of the executed former prime 
minister, and Nawaz Sharif (b. 1949). Bhutto became the first woman 
to lead a modern Muslim nation. But her rule, as her father’s had 
been, was marred by charges of corruption, and she was dismissed 
from office, only to rise once more as prime minister before suffering 
another tumble from power. Sharif, scion of one of Pakistan’s wealthi-
est families, whose power base was among the landless lower class, 
also lost and regained his office. Under his leadership the Pakistan 
Muslim League, the 1962 successor to the disbanded Muslim League, 
reemerged as a powerful political party. But political infighting again 
began to immobilize the machinery of state. Fearing another military 
takeover Sharif attempted to forestall a coup, but, instead, his efforts 
accelerated it. Once again Pakistan came under martial law and a 
general’s rule, this time in the person of General Pervez Musharraf (b. 
1943). Also during this period the still-unsettled Kashmir question 
again brought Pakistan and India to the brink of war, only this time 
the presence of nuclear weapons escalated the stakes in the standoff 
between the countries.

Benazir Bhutto’s First Government
On August 17, 1988, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, former chairman of the Senate, 
succeeded General Zia ul-Haq and became interim president, as stipulated 
by the constitution. Ishaq Khan established an emergency council of 
advisers and directed general elections be held in November 1988.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

PREPARING FOR DESTINY

The following excerpts from Benazir Bhutto’s 1989 autobiography, 
Daughter of Destiny, reveal Bhutto’s hopes and fears during the 

fi nal years of the Zia regime. As Pakistan moved toward elections 
scheduled for November 1988, a nervous Zia announced a new law 
that called for nonparty elections. The law was to have been imple-
mented too late for the opposition to challenge it in court. But Zia 
and 30 others, including the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan and an 
American general, died in a plane crash while returning to Islamabad 
from a military base in eastern Pakistan.

I felt confi dant as 1987 dawned. . . . [A]fter the long ban on 
political activities, we were building the PPP as a political institu-
tion. Launching a membership drive, we enrolled a million mem-
bers in four months, a remarkable fi gure for Pakistan, where 
the literacy rates are so low. We held party elections in the 
Punjab—an unheard of phenomenon in the subcontinent—in 
which over four hundred thousand members voted. We opened 
a dialogue with the opponents of the Muslim League in the 
Parliament and continued to highlight the human rights viola-
tions of the regime. . . .

On May 29, 1988, General Zia abruptly dissolved Parliament, 
dismissed his own handpicked Prime Minister, and called for 
elections. I was at a meeting . . . with party members from 
Larkana when the startling message was passed to me. “You 
must be mistaken,” I said to the party offi cial who had sent 
me the note. “General Zia avoids elections. He doesn’t hold 
them.”. . .

Regardless, the mood throughout the country was ebullient. 
Zia’s own constitution called for elections within ninety days of 
the dissolution of the government, and to many it seemed that 
victory was within reach. . . . “No one can stop the PPP now,” said 
one supporter after another. . . .

On June 15th, Zia announced the installation of Shariah, or 
Islamic law, as the supreme law of the land. . . . Many thought 
that the timing of Zia’s latest exploitation of Islam was directed 
at me. The Urdu press was speculating that he could use the 
interpretation of the law by Islamic bigots to try to prevent me, a 
woman, from standing for election.

CIVILIAN RULE RESTORED

Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of former prime minister Zulfikar 
Bhutto, who had taken over the leadership of the Pakistan People’s 
Party (PPP) after her father’s execution in 1979, returned from exile 
when martial law was lifted in 1986.

After a decade of authoritarian military rule, the return of a Bhutto to 
Pakistan’s political landscape helped energize the democracy movement. 
Benazir Bhutto was born in Karachi and educated at Radcliffe College 
in the United States and Oxford University in England. She returned to 
Pakistan in June 1977 with the intention of entering the foreign service. 
Two weeks later General Zia ul-Haq staged his coup and arrested Prime 
Minister Zulfikar Bhutto. Benazir Bhutto spent the next 18 months in 
and out of house arrest. The execution of her father in 1979 served 
only to intensify her efforts to coordinate opposition to Zia’s regime. In 
the summer of 1981 she was imprisoned for five months under solitary 
confinement in Sind. She was released in 1984 and went into exile in 
London. Her return to Pakistan in 1986 was greeted by a welcoming 
crowd of hundreds of thousands in Lahore. She began organizing the 
opposition and calling on Zia to resign and hold national elections.

Had Zia not perished it is possible that the elections he had sched-
uled would have been canceled or the state apparatus would have been 
marshaled to ensure his electoral victory. But without him the 1988 
election campaign proceeded as planned. The PPP remained unaligned 
and independent of other political parties. In the November elections 
the PPP won a majority in Sind, but no party gained a majority in any 
other province. Nonetheless, the PPP was the only party to have a 
significant following in all four provinces. Moreover, it was the largest 
party in the National Assembly, with 94 seats, one of them occupied by 
newly elected Benazir Bhutto.

Under the Revival of the Constitution of 1973 Order enacted by Zia, the 
president could appoint any member of the National Assembly as prime 
minister. With the backing of both the PPP and the Islami Jamhuri Itehad 
(IJI, or Islamic Democratic Alliance), a coalition of nine parties formed 
that year to oppose the PPP in elections, Ghulam Ishaq Khan won the 
legislative election for president on December 13, 1988. Following tradi-
tion as well as privilege, Ishaq Khan chose Benazir Bhutto, leader of the 
dominant party, to form a new government and serve as prime minister.

In order to form a government, Bhutto had to jettison the PPP’s non-
aligned stance and forge a coalition with the Muhajir Qaumi Mahaz 
(MQM, or Muhajir National Movement), which represented the muha-
jir (refugees from India following partition) community and several 
other parties. The MQM agreed to back the PPP at both the national

and the provincial assemblies. Both parties pledged equal protection to 
all people of Sind, important to the muhajirs as they often felt discrimi-
nated against by native Sindis.

In her first address to the nation as prime minister, Bhutto presented 
her vision of a Pakistan that was forward-thinking and democratic but 
guided by Islamic principles. She announced the release of political pris-
oners, restoration of press freedoms, and the implementation of stalled 
educational and healthcare reforms. The ban on student unions and trade 
unions was lifted. She promised increased provincial autonomy, greater 
rights for women, and better relations with the United States, Russia, and 
China. Improved relations with India were pursued in December 1988 at 
the fourth SAARC Summit Conference, where the path was cleared for 
the acceptance of three peace agreements between Pakistan and India.

Bhutto’s Foreign Policy
The end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which occurred in the 
last days of Zia’s rule, signaled a change in Pakistan’s foreign relations. 
The Geneva Accords, which ended the war, were signed in April 1988, 

228

CIVILIAN RULE RESTORED

and the following month Soviet forces began their withdrawal. Border 
skirmishes continued as mujahideen attacks went on, some staged from 
Pakistan. But Pakistan had lost its strategic importance in the cold war. 
Without the cold war, whose end was marked by the collapse of the 
Berlin Wall in November 1989, the economic and military blandish-
ments both sides had offered Pakistan and other emerging countries 
had come to an end.

Benazir Bhutto had been a persistent critic of Zia’s alliance with the 
United States and had denounced him for allowing Pakistan to be used 
as a base for the mujahideen. But after taking office, she attempted to 
strengthen the country’s alliance with the United States. Like her father, 
Benazir Bhutto was an indefatigable traveler, making frequent trips to 
meet with heads of state around the world. In June 1989 Bhutto visited 
the United States to allay fears of Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities. She 
told the administration that Pakistan had no nuclear weapons, but 
defended her nation’s right to pursue its nuclear program. In an address 
to a joint session of Congress she proclaimed Pakistan’s willingness to 
make a pact with India declaring the subcontinent a nuclear-free zone. 
Bhutto tried to ease tensions with India while seeking solutions to the 
disputes—primarily Kashmir—that had bedeviled relations since the 
birth of the two nations. In 1989 Rajiv Gandhi (r. 1984–89), India’s 
prime minister, visited Bhutto in Islamabad. In talks Bhutto reiterated 
Pakistan’s willingness to make the region a nuclear-free zone, a pro-
posal Gandhi declined to consider.

Bhutto succeeded in gaining readmission to the Commonwealth in 
1989, making Pakistan eligible for trading privileges with other domin-
ions, which the country desperately needed. Previous efforts to rejoin 
had been blocked by India on the grounds that Pakistan was not a 
democracy, as it was under military rule. With a civilian again in charge 
of the nation, that objection was voided.

Bhutto’s Domestic Policy
Bhutto championed a Western secularist, socialist agenda, eschewing 
the pro-Islamic policies of the Zia regime. Women’s social and health 
issues were staples of her campaigns. However, her stated policies were 
rarely translated into action. No legislation to improve welfare services 
for women was proposed. Campaign promises to repeal Hudood and 
Zina ordinances, which called for punishments such as amputations for 
theft and stoning for adultery, went unfulfilled. To be sure, Bhutto faced 
significant obstacles in advancing any legislative agenda.

229

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Much of the decision making remained in the hands of the military 
and the intelligence agencies, where Zia had placed it. Bhutto was reluc-
tant to challenge these powers, since the military had time and again 
demonstrated readiness to take over the government when threatened. 
Perhaps she was fearful as well—the army, after all, was the institution 
responsible for the execution of her father.

She had also inherited many political enemies of her father’s, and 
Pakistani politics remained as focused on personal power and games-
manship as on advancing the national interest. A major PPP adversary 
was Nawaz Sharif, leader of the PML and chief minister of Punjab, the 
most populous province. The PML and PPP were natural enemies; PPP 
founder Zulfikar Bhutto had nationalized industries to break the power 
of Pakistan’s wealthiest families, and one of those families was Nawaz 
Sharif’s. Moreover, Nawaz Sharif was a protégé of Zia, the military 
ruler who had Zulfikar Bhutto hanged. Benazir Bhutto spent an inor-
dinate amount of time and effort trying to oust Nawaz Sharif from his 
post in the Punjab. Another problem Bhutto faced was in the person 
of President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, with whom she clashed repeatedly, 
especially over military and judicial appointments.

Just as significant, Bhutto was unable to parlay the electoral success 
of the PPP coalition and her own popularity into creating a cohesive 
domestic policy for Pakistan. Bhutto’s alliance with the MQM, while put-
ting the PPP over the top in the national elections, proved an obstacle 
when it came to parliamentary action. Furthermore, her alliance with 
the rival political bloc weakened her credibility within the PPP (though 
it never threatened her leadership of the party), especially among the 
Sindi nationalists who had been among her strongest supporters. One of 
Bhutto’s notable shortcomings during this and her second administration 
as prime minister was her failure to follow through on her announced 
campaign initiatives to improve women’s health care and other social 
issues concerning women. In fact, “the PPP government’s performance 
was lacklustre, with not a single new piece of legislation being passed or 
even introduced, apart from two annual budgets” (Jacques 2000, 170).

Another, but no less important, domestic issue where Bhutto floun-
dered regarded Islam. Like her father, Benazir Bhutto was a secular-
ist who, as an opposition leader, had denounced Zia’s move toward 
Islamization of Pakistan. As prime minister she altered this stance for 
political expediency but discovered that other groups and leaders were 
farther ahead than she was in this approach. Nevertheless, her hard-line 
stance in early 1990 regarding the ongoing Kashmir dispute with India 
gained her credibility with the religious party Jamaat-i-Islami.

CIVILIAN RULE RESTORED

Despite these problems Bhutto’s first term as prime minister was not 
completely ineffectual. During her 20 months in power, she ended a 
ban on unions in Pakistan and, as part of her program to modernize 
Pakistan, she pushed for rural electrification. She also attempted to 
encourage private investment in the Pakistani economy.

However, her efforts were hampered by the ethnic violence that 
pervaded Sind and would ultimately cause the MQM to remove itself 
from the ruling coalition, paralyzing Pakistan’s Parliament and further 
destabilizing Bhutto’s domestic program.

The Political Landscape of Sind
Following partition in 1947 Urdu-speaking Muslims from India, called 
muhajir, “migrant,” in Urdu, settled in Sind’s urban centers of Karachi, 
Hyderabad, and Sukkar. Concurrently, many Hindus left for India. The 
shift profoundly changed the dynamics of Sind’s economy and politics. 
Muhajirs were generally nationalists, believing in the ideal of a united 
Islamic country, and opposed ethnic identification. Primarily middle 
class and better educated than native-born Pakistanis, muhajirs came 
to dominate the Civil Service of Pakistan (CSP) and formed a powerful 
administrative class. With muhajir support, efforts were made to adopt 
Urdu as Pakistan’s national language as a way to unify the country and 
forge a national identity. But Sindis, whose language is called Sindi, felt 
their culture threatened, and when Urdu was made a compulsory sub-
ject in primary schools in 1962, Sindis called a strike in response, one 
of the first large-scale manifestations of Sindi-muhajir conflict.

During Ayub Khan’s reign the Punjabi-Pashtun-dominated military 
took increasing charge of the state bureaucracy, reducing muhajir con-
trol over the CSP. The move of the capital from Karachi, the center of 
muhajir power, to Islamabad also diminished the émigrés’ influence.

Sindis saw Zulfikar Bhutto, scion of a Sindi family of feudal land-
owners, as empowering Sindi nationalism and were core PPP support-
ers. The muhajir, on the other hand, rightly viewed Zulfikar Bhutto 
as an adversary. He made the study of Sindi compulsory in school, 
provoking language riots in 1972 as Sindi and muhajirs battled over 
the compulsory instruction. In the 1973 constitution Bhutto also 
introduced a quota system reserving 1.4 percent of posts in the central 
administration for rural Sindis. At the time, muhajirs held 35.5 percent 
of the civil service posts, although they constituted only 8 percent of 
the population. Bhutto also instituted a quota policy mandating that 60 
percent of state jobs be reserved for rural residents and 40 percent for 

231

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

urban residents and a similar quota for admissions to state-owned uni-
versities. These quotas were enacted to improve the lot of rural popula-
tions, which represented the majority of Sindis. Bhutto also reformed 
the CSP, further reducing muhajir power. More language riots erupted 
in 1972 after the Sind assembly made Sindi the province’s official lan-
guage, while Urdu was adopted as the official language in Baluchistan, 
NWFP, and Punjab.

In 1978 growing feelings of muhajir disenfranchisement led Altaf 
Hussain (b. 1963) to form the All Pakistan Muhajir Student Organization 
(APMSO). The group quickly won converts from Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba 
(UT), the student wing of Jamaat-i-Islami, making the muhajir move-
ment an adversary of the UT from its inception. The two groups clashed 
on college campuses in the early 1980s during Zia’s rule. Following 
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Pashtun refugees settled in 
Karachi. Many went into transportation and moneylending businesses 
and into housing, a market previously controlled by Punjabis and muh-
ajirs, leading to tensions between Pashtuns and their muhajir tenants. 
In the mid-1980s Pashtun-owned minibuses, called the yellow devils, 
were causing an average of two deaths per day. In 1985 a Pashtun bus 
driver in Karachi ran a red light and plowed into a group of students 
from Sir Syed College. The accident triggered a protest by muhajir stu-
dent activists, which was joined by muhajir renters and soon erupted 
into pitched battles called the transportation riots, between muhajirs 
and Pashtuns. In their aftermath, the Pashtuns formed an alliance with 
the Punjabis, with whom they already had dealings through their arms 
trade with the Punjabi-dominated military.

Muhajir ethnic consciousness overcame its nationalist impulses in 
1984 with the rise of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), now 
officially known as Muttahida Qaumi Movement, or United National 
Movement, which had its origin in APMSO. MQM quickly gained 
power in the urban centers of Sind, winning the mayorships of Karachi 
and Hyderabad in 1988. Government efforts to weaken the party led 
to its splintering into two factions: the main party, MQM(A), led by 
Altaf Hussain, and an offshoot, the MQM(H), for Haqiqi (or “truth”) 
faction, which appealed to religious fundamentalists and was under 
the influence of the Pakistani government. Fighting between the two 
factions and with police and security agencies has claimed many lives 
in Karachi.

In the 1988 elections the MQM allied with the PPP, now headed by 
Benazir Bhutto, and emerged as the third-largest party in the National 
Assembly. To win their support, Bhutto had pledged to protect and safe-

guard the interests of all the people of Sind, regardless of language, reli-
gion, or origin of birth, as well as to stamp out violence and to support 
the rule of law. But tensions between the Sindis, the PPP’s traditional 
base, and MQM supporters continued. In October 1988 hundreds of 
Sindis were killed during a protest in Hyderabad, for which the muha-
jir were blamed, triggering ethnic riots between the communities. In 
August 1989 MQM officially ended its alliance with the PPP, claiming 
the ruling party had failed to live up to its agreements. From May of 
that year to the following June, hundreds more died in ethnic violence 
between the two groups.

President Ishaq Khan Dissolves the Government
Bhutto was eager to reinstate the constitution of 1973, voiding the 1985 
Zia amendments that allowed the president to dismiss the government 
and dissolve legislative assemblies, and to return the country to a parlia-
mentary form of government. It would also assure she could not be dis-
missed from office. Failing to gain sufficient support, she soon dropped 
the effort. On August 6, 1990, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, invok-
ing the Eighth Amendment of 1985 and Article 58 2(b), dismissed the 
Bhutto government, alleging corruption and incompetence; dissolved the 
National Assembly; and declared a state of emergency. One of the nation’s 
best-known journalists wrote at the time, “The scenario presented has 
become depressingly familiar—like repeat performances of a B grade 
movie. A well-rehearsed procedure is carried out, even the words used by 
the person in high authority to justify his action are paraphrases of what 
has been heard before, including the charges of corruption and ineptness 
leveled against the targeted incumbents . . .” (Khan 1998, 466).

Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, leader of the Combined Opposition Parties, a 
second coalition party opposed to the PPP, was named caretaker prime 
minister (r. Aug.–Nov. 1990) after the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto’s 
government. A native of Sind and one of Pakistan’s largest landowners, 
Jatoi had been a PPP veteran and was in the first cabinet of Benazir 
Bhutto’s father. But he was removed as head of the PPP in Sind upon 
Benazir Bhutto’s return in 1986 and left the party. The partisanship 
behind selecting a member of the opposition rather than a member 
from the leading party magnified the sting of Ishaq Khan’s action. Ishaq 
Khan soon dissolved the provincial assemblies as well and scheduled 
new elections for October 1990. Benazir Bhutto’s husband, Asif Ali 
Zardari (b. 1956), was arrested on charges of blackmail and imprisoned 
for more than two years.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Mustafa Jatoi was also in charge of the accountability proceed-
ings aimed at investigating and bringing to justice members of the 
national government accused of corruption and malfeasance. Bhutto 
was charged and testified before the accountability tribunals, but she 
remained free to conduct her political activities.

1990 Elections
Nawaz Sharif campaigned on a platform of conservative government 
and ending corruption. The elections for national and provincial 
assemblies were held on October 24 and 27, respectively. The caretaker 
government, chosen for its partisanship, took an active role in assist-
ing the Islamic Democratic Alliance (IJI) in winning the elections. His 
Pakistan Muslim League (PML) had the backing of the IJI as well as 
the MQM. Evidence exists that the ISI, the state intelligence agency, 
engineered the IJI’s initial support for Sharif during the 1990 election. 
During his second term as prime minister he was to lose the support 
of the IJI after he took a more secular course during his second term as 
prime minister. Despite widespread complaints of election irregulari-
ties, outside observers declared the 1990 election generally fair. More 
than 40 deaths were linked to election violence.

About 45 percent of the 47 million registered voters cast ballots. In the 
National Assembly 217 seats, 10 of which were held by non-Muslims and 
20 of which were reserved for women, were to be chosen by the elected 
members. The principal parties were the Pakistan Democratic Alliance 
(PDA), dominated by the PPP, and the IJI, dominated by the PML. The 
PDA campaigned on the issue of the illegal dismissal of the government. 
The IJI stressed the incompetence of the Bhutto government as well as 
the corruption charges against it. The IJI trounced the PPP-led alliance, 
taking 105 seats to the PDA’s 45 seats. The MQM won 15 seats, while the 
Awami National Party (ANP) and Assembly of Islamic Clergy (JUI) split 
a dozen seats between them. Independents and others took 30 seats.

Benazir Bhutto continued her opposition efforts during Sharif’s rule, 
including attempts to mount large-scale antigovernment protests. In 
1992 Sharif banned her from the nation’s capital and had her confined 
to Karachi though she was not placed under house arrest.

became prime minister for the first time (r. 1990–93, 1997–99). He 
was a native of Lahore and scion of one of Pakistan’s most prominent 
families.

In his first address to the nation he promised a comprehensive 
national reconstruction program and to increase the pace of industri-
alization. His leadership, after that of Bhutto and Jatoi, whose families 
were rooted in the rural aristocracy, represented the ascending impor-
tance and power of the industrial class. Identifying unemployment as 
the nation’s primary problem, Nawaz Sharif saw industrialization as 
the cure.

Nawaz Sharif was a political moderate, but he was also a religious 
conservative and a Zia protégé, comfortable returning the country to 
a more Islamic course. And from a political and pragmatic perspec-
tive, his coalition included the Islamist JUI party, whose support was 
needed to maintain the coalition. Sharif ’s backing for a conservative 
religious agenda would cement their allegiance. In May 1991 his gov-
ernment passed the Shariat Bill—the bill that Zia had tried but failed 
to push through the National Assembly in 1985—which made the 
Qur’an and the Sunna the law of the land provided that “the present 
political system . . . and the existing system of Government, shall not be

challenged” and provided that “the right of the non-Muslims guaranteed 
by or under the Constitution” shall not be infringed upon (Enforcement 
of Shari’ah Act, 1991, Act X of 1991, Section 3). The act was unpopu-
lar with both secularists and fundamentalists, the former fearing that 
Pakistan was becoming a theocracy, the latter angry that the law did 
not go far enough. Although a government group whose task it was to 
assist Islamization recommended several immediate steps, the act was 
never enforced. For example, in November 1991 the nation’s supreme 
religious court, the Federal Shariat Court, declared a score of federal and 
provincial laws repugnant to Islam and therefore void, including one 
pertaining to the payment of interest. However, bans on interest on all 
loans would have been an impediment to Nawaz Sharif’s industrializa-
tion plans. The ruling was appealed and never implemented.

Sharif ’s Economic Policy
A conservative industrialist whose family “owned the biggest industrial 
empire in the country” (Bennett Jones 2002, 231), Sharif supported 
an economic policy focused on restoring to the private sector indus-
tries that had been nationalized by Zulfikar Bhutto. This was as much 
personal as it was domestic policy to increase tax revenue: In 1972 
Zulfikar Bhutto had nationalized the Sharif family’s Ittefaq Foundary. 
(The company was denationalized in 1979, around the time Nawaz 
Sharif was beginning his political career.) Sharif also went farther than 
Benazir Bhutto in enticing foreign investment by opening Pakistan’s 
stock market to foreign capital, and foreign exchange restrictions 
were loosened during this time. (However, in his second government 
Sharif inexplicably reversed this trend when he voided contracts signed 
between foreign power companies and the Bhutto government.) Having 
no ties to the landowning aristocracy, Sharif also undertook targeted 
land reform efforts in Sind, where land was distributed to the poor. 
He also “had a penchant for costly projects of questionable economic 
value” (Kux 2001, 44). Large development projects, such as the Ghazi 
Barotha Hydro Power Project on the Indus River in Punjab, the Gwadar 
Miniport in Baluchistan, and, in his second government, a superhigh-
way connecting Lahore and Islamabad, were commissioned. Perhaps 
Sharif’s most controversial economic program involved the distribution 
of “tens of thousands of taxis” to towns and villages. Technically, the 
government subsidized the purchase of the imported taxis by young 
men with the agreement that these “loans” would be repaid, but well 
into the Musharraf regime few of the loans had been paid off.

Sharif’s economic policies placed him in good standing with the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The latter 
especially played a role in Pakistan’s economic life during the 1990s, 
as the country, under changing leadership, struggled to remain sol-
vent. However, IMF assistance was contingent upon debt reduction by 
Pakistan. Pakistan’s national debt impeded Sharif’s economic policies, 
and this was compounded by the suspension of the United States’s 
military and economic assistance program (in response to Pakistan’s 
nuclear-weapons program), and the end of the Soviet-Afghan War. 
Because of the fear of a Soviet threat on its border, Pakistan was able 
to garner foreign aid amounting to as much as 2.7 percent of its gross 
national product, equal to $10 per capita in 1990. Within seven years 
the per capita amount had fallen to half that amount (Kux, 2001, 44). 
Exacerbating Pakistan’s dire economic situation during this time was a 
decline in worker remittances from the Persian Gulf.

The damage to the economy done by the unpaid taxi loans actually 
paled in comparison to the unpaid loans of various Pakistani politi-
cians, including Sharif himself. These unpaid loans contributed to the 
destabilization of Pakistan’s banking system so that by the late 1990s it 
was on the verge of collapse.

Foreign Policy and Kalashnikov Culture
In foreign affairs Nawaz Sharif strengthened relations with Central Asia’s 
Muslim republics that had formed in the wake of the Soviet Union’s col-
lapse in 1991. Pakistan also joined the international coalition to drive 
Iraq out of Kuwait during the Gulf War (1990–91), although the largest 
religious party in the IJI coalition, the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI, or Islamic 
Assembly), opposed the policy, as a defeat of Iraq would strengthen the 
Shi’i regime in Iran.

Across the border to the west, Afghanistan was disintegrating 
into chaos. After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 and the fall of the 
Communist government in 1992, warring factions carved the nation 
into fiefdoms, and law and order broke down. Nawaz Sharif attempted 
to broker a peace among the competing factions with the Islamabad 
Accord, negotiated under his direction, but the violence continued. The 
lawlessness spread into Pakistan. Fueled by ethnic and political rivalries 
and easy access to weapons, crime and terrorism in the country grew 
rampant. Pakistanis labeled this outbreak of violence “the Kalashnikov 
culture,” after the ubiquitous Soviet-made automatic weapon that made 
the carnage possible.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

BANK OF CREDIT AND 
COMMERCE INTERNATIONAL 

(BCCI)

Prime Minister Zulfi kar Bhutto nationalized Pakistan’s privately 
owned banks in 1974. However, foreign banks could still oper-

ate in the country. One of the most important was BCCI, the 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Though chartered in 
Luxembourg, BCCI had three major branches in Pakistan and was 
founded by a well-connected Pakistani banker, Agha Hasan Abedi 
(1922–95). Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s family business was a major 
borrower. In 1991, the year that banking was opened to Pakistan’s 
private sector under the government’s economic liberalization pro-
gram, the BCCI collapsed in what was called the biggest bank fraud 
in history, estimated to have involved losses of between $10 billion 
and $17 billion. A U.S. Senate report completed in 1992 concluded 
BCCI was “a fundamentally corrupt criminal enterprise” (Kerry and 
Brown, 1992, 1). In addition to fraud, money laundering, and bribery, 
the report also charged the bank with “support of terrorism, arms 
traffi cking, and the sale of nuclear technologies; management of pros-
titution; the commission and facilitation of income tax evasion, smug-
gling, and illegal immigration; illicit purchases of banks and real estate; 
and a panoply of fi nancial crimes limited only by the imagination of its 
offi cers and customers” (ibid., 1). The Pakistani branches were con-
duits for signifi cant parts of these activities. BCCI received additional 
attention in the United States for two reasons: The bank was found to 
have secretly acquired 25 percent ownership of a large U.S. bank, First 
American, without regulatory approval, violating U.S. law; and it was 
found that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been aware for 
several years of BCCI’s activities, but had not informed other agen-
cies, prompting speculation that the spy agency itself may have been 
among those taking advantage of the bank’s lax controls and illegal 
practices. Most of the fi nancial losses had mundane roots: poor busi-
ness practices and bad lending decisions. In the years since, most lost 
funds were recovered through forfeitures, fi nes, and settlements.

The roots of the violence lay in the cultural heritage of the Pashtun, 
for whom carrying a gun has long been a tradition born of necessity. 
Defense of tribal lands, banditry, blood feuds, and pursuit of badal, or 
revenge, all required firearms. The availability of weapons increased

dramatically in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion. Black market 
Soviet weapons and guns intended for the mujahideen swept into 
Pakistan. So did heroin. Afghan warlords, who managed the fight 
against the Soviets, financed arms purchases in part by the trafficking 
of heroin, refined from Afghanistan’s abundant opium crop at hundreds 
of small labs. A culture of smuggling and drug trafficking grew. Arms 
were also needed to protect the heroin.

The Pakistani towns of Sakhkot, which had a gun market boasting 
more than 200 gun dealers, and Darra Adam Khel, 25 miles south of 
Sakhkot, where townspeople craft working imitations of almost any 
handgun or rifle, became symbols of the Kalashnikov culture.

Pakistan had virtually no drug culture prior to the Afghan war. The 
number of heroin addicts went from fewer than 10,000 to 12,000 in 
1979 to more than 500,000 by the mid-1980s and as many as 3 million 
to 4 million by 1999. Many refugees from the war resettled in urban 
areas of Pakistan, particularly in Karachi. The cycle of guns, addic-
tion, and violence took root here too. By the late 1980s, Karachi and 
Hyderabad were being compared to Beirut for their level of violence.

Adding to the problem of violence is the police force, whose members 
are typically regarded as corrupt and ineffective. Those who want justice 
seem compelled to seek it for themselves, and taking the law into one’s 
own hands rarely carries consequences from law enforcement agencies.

In an effort to stem the chaos the Sharif government ordered citi-
zens to turn in weapons, with little success. To deal quickly with those 
sowing the mayhem the legislature passed the Twelfth Amendment, 
which allowed for the quick establishment of trial courts to dispense 
summary justice.

Pakistan’s legislative bodies mirrored the chaos. Dissension grew rife 
in the IJI coalition, particularly within the Pakistan Muslim League, 
the IJI’s largest party. The right-of-center and religious parties compris-
ing the coalition had been united in their opposition to the PPP, but 
with their primary adversary defeated, their unity splintered. Relations 
between Nawaz Sharif and President Ishaq Khan were also souring. In 
1993 the prime minister and president began trying to oust each other 
through behind-the-scenes maneuvering.

As he had once before, on April 19, 1993, President Ishaq Kahn 
invoked the Eighth Amendment, dismissed Nawaz Sharif and his gov-
ernment for corruption, and dissolved the National Assembly. Ishaq 
Khan named Balakh Sher Khan Mazari (r. April–May, 1993), head of a 
clan of landowners, as the caretaker prime minister. General elections 
were scheduled for July 1993. However, in May the Supreme Court 
overturned the presidential order ousting the government, and Nawaz

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

LAW ENFORCEMENT

The basic structure of Pakistan’s police force was defi ned in 
Article 23 of the Indian Police Act of 1861. The police were 

responsible for preventing crime and detecting and arresting criminals, 
executing orders and warrants, and gathering and reporting informa-
tion concerning public order. Other than revisions to the act dating 
from 1888 and the adoption of the Police Rules of 1934, the document 
still defi nes the role of Pakistan’s police. The mission or approach 
changed little after partition. Each of the four provinces has its own 
police force, and traditionally there has been little integration of their 
operations. The senior positions are staffed by members of the Police 
Service of Pakistan, an organization similar to the Civil Service of 
Pakistan. Members are relatively well paid and have a greater degree 
of power than other civil servants; therefore, it is often the fi rst 
choice of high-ranking students seeking entry to government service.

Each provincial force is headed by an inspector general, aided by 
a deputy inspector general and an assistant inspector general. They 
oversee the work of a division, or range, which coordinates police 
activity within areas of each province. Most police work is conducted 
at the district level, under the direction of a superintendent, and at 
the subdistrict level, headed by an assistant or deputy superintendent. 
The great majority of police personnel are assigned to subdistrict 
stations. The lowest rank is constable, then, in ascending order, head 
constable, assistant subinspector, subinspector, sergeant, and inspec-
tor. Larger cities have their own police forces, but these are under the 
direction of the provincial police forces. Police in Pakistan are gener-
ally unarmed. They frequently use a lathi, a fi ve-foot wooden staff, for 
crowd control, used to hold back throngs or as a club. Traditionally 
provincial police were almost exclusively male. Under Benazir Bhutto 
women were inducted into the police force as part of a campaign for 
equal rights for women.

Sharif was reinstated as prime minister. He and the president remained 
at odds, bringing the government to a standstill.

Benazir Bhutto’s Second Government
In July 1993, after two weeks of negotiations, both Nawaz Sharif and 
Ishaq Khan resigned their positions, and the national and provincial

assemblies were dissolved once again. Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi 
(r. July–Oct. 1993), a senior World Bank official, was named caretaker 
prime minister, and Wasim Sajjad (r. July–Nov. 1993), Senate chair-
man, the caretaker president. Though he served only a few months, 
Moeenuddin Qureshi undertook important reforms. Without concern 
that he would be voted out of office, he made tough decisions that 
would have been difficult for an ambitious politician. Qureshi devalued 
the currency, cut farm subsidies, slashed public sector expenditures, 
and eliminated 15 ministries. He also raised the prices of critical items, 
including wheat, gasoline, and electricity. Qureshi also published the 
names of individuals with unpaid loans from state banks totaling some 
$2 billion; the list included many prominent politicians. Those who 
failed to repay their debts were barred from running for office in the 
upcoming October 1993 elections.

Bhutto’s Return
New national and provincial elections were held October 6–7, 1993. The 
PPP campaigned on the platform of an “Agenda for Change,” focused 
on improvements of social services. The MQM boycotted the election. 
Turnout was low, with only about 40 percent of those eligible voting. The 
Pakistan Muslim League (PML) led by Nawaz Sharif won 72 seats. The 
PPP won a plurality, with 86 seats in the National Assembly, but failed 
to win a majority. Yet the party did well in all four provinces. Bhutto, 
through a coalition with minor parties and independents, achieved a 
majority, earning the right to form a new government. In November, the 
national and provincial assemblies elected as president Farooq Ahmed 
Khan Leghari (r. 1993–97), a young PPP party loyalist. Hailing from a 
family of hereditary chiefs of the prominent Leghari tribe, Leghari began 
his career in the civil service after earning a degree from England’s Oxford 
University. His service as government appointee and elected official was 
interrupted by four years in prison during the martial-law years after 
1983. In his first address as president, Leghari pledged to revoke the 
Eighth Amendment, which had previously been used to dissolve govern-
ments at presidential whim. He also supported weakening the power of 
religious courts and expanding women’s rights. With the prime minister 
and president from the same party, many hoped the continual warring 
between these offices would end. But Leghari was soon embroiled in 
scandal and controversy, dooming his push for reforms.

Bhutto and the opposition, particularly the MQM, continued to be 
at loggerheads. In the fall of 1994 Nawaz Sharif embarked on a “train

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

march,” traveling by rail from Karachi to Peshawar to dramatize their 
opposition to the Bhutto government. The “march” drew massive 
crowds along the route in a display of the agitational and confronta-
tional tactics that characterized both Pakistani politics and these two 
bitter rivals. In September a general strike was declared, and Nawaz 
Sharif called for another demonstration of resistance in October. Bhutto 
arrested several opposition leaders who took part in the protests, draw-
ing widespread condemnation.

Relationship with the United States
Throughout the late 1980s Pakistani officials made statements indicat-
ing the country had achieved a nuclear capability, as intelligence reports 
continued to describe advances in its weapons program. Since 1990 
the United States had been withholding delivery of 28 F-16 fighter jets 
Pakistan had ordered—and paid for at a cost of $1.2 billion—under 
the terms of the Pressler Amendment, enacted by the U.S. Congress 
in 1985. The amendment required that before the president could 
authorize foreign aid to Pakistan, he had to certify that the country 
was not developing and did not possess nuclear weapons. President 
Ronald Reagan had waived the requirement, as allowed by the law, in 
1988, when Pakistan’s assistance in the U.S. fight against the Soviet 
occupation of Afghanistan seemed crucial. However, the Soviets had 
withdrawn in 1989, and in 1990 President George H. W. Bush (r. 
1989–93) did not certify Pakistan as a nuclear-free nation, thereby 
triggering an aid embargo. At the time, Pakistan was the third largest 
recipient of U.S. military assistance—after Israel and Egypt. In 1986 the 
United States and Pakistan had agreed on a $4 billion economic devel-
opment and security assistance program that Pakistan would receive, 
paid out from 1988 to 1993. Pakistan was in the midst of an ambitious 
program to refurbish its armed forces, looking across the border at its 
bigger, nuclear-armed enemy, India. In addition to depriving Pakistan 
of material it needed to have a credible defensive force, the Pressler 
Amendment targeted only Pakistan, though other nations were known 
to have nuclear weapons programs that violated the terms of the UN 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Moreover, India had started the nuclear 
arms race and had escaped all penalties of the Symington and Pressler 
amendments. Relations between Pakistan and the United States deterio-
rated sharply from 1990 through 1993, as issues of weapons develop-
ment, terrorism, and narcotics caused a growing rift between Islamabad 
and Washington. In 1992 the United States almost declared Pakistan

a state sponsor of terrorism, primarily due to its support for Kashmiri 
militants. In the summer of 1993 the United States placed more sanc-
tions on Pakistan, charging it with receiving prohibited missile technol-
ogy from China.

In late 1993 U.S. president Bill Clinton (r. 1993–2001) proposed 
revising the Pressler Amendment, citing the unequal treatment 
of Pakistan and India over their respective nuclear programs. But 
Clinton faced strong objections from legislators and withdrew his 
proposal in early 1994. A few months later his administration pro-
posed a one-time sale of F16s, contingent upon Pakistan pledging to 
cap the production of weapons-grade uranium. This proposal paral-
leled a liberalization of Pakistan’s economy to a more market-based 
system, which the United States was eager to encourage. In January 
1995, the thawing relationship between the two nations was under-
scored by a visit to Pakistan by U.S. defense secretary William Perry 
(r. 1994–97). Following the visit, Perry proclaimed that the Pressler 
Amendment had failed in its objective to halt Pakistan’s nuclear 
program and had actually been counterproductive. Benazir Bhutto 
traveled to Washington, D.C., in April, and in early 1996 the Brown 
Amendment was passed, which removed nonmilitary aid from the 
purview of the Pressler Amendment and gave the president a onetime 
waiver to permit the release of the military equipment embargoed 
since 1990. President Clinton authorized the release of some $368 
million in military equipment. Though the F-16s were not among the 
approved items, Clinton pledged to reimburse Pakistan for the money 
it had already paid for the jets. Meanwhile, Pakistan continued to 
make progress in its nuclear program.

A visit to Pakistan by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her 
daughter, Chelsea, in 1995 helped project to the world an image of 
Pakistan as a modern, progressive country. Bhutto’s visit to the United 
States the previous year had already helped raise the country’s visibility. 
International investment in Pakistan increased.

Bhutto’s Central Asia Policy
Benazir Bhutto continued to pursue the country’s long-standing policy 
of seeking influence and power in Afghanistan to balance the threat 
felt from India. During her first term as prime minister, training camps 
for mujahideen had remained open, and Pakistan had issued visas for 
thousands of militants from more than 20 countries traveling to the 
camps. The goal, many observers believed, was to maintain an army of

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

jihadists who could be deployed to wage proxy wars against Pakistan’s 
rivals in Kashmir and Central Asia.

Bhutto had accompanied her father to Simla when he signed the 
agreement with India in 1972 that ended the war triggered by East 
Pakistan’s declaration of independence and laid down the blueprint for 
future peaceful relations between the two signatories. But it was evident 
Bhutto intended to keep a force of militants available to use as a weapon 
against India in Kashmir.

When Bhutto was reelected for a second term as prime minister in 
1993, she was eager to encourage trade with Pakistan’s neighbors in 
Central Asia. As part of that initiative she backed a pipeline running 
from Turkmenistan through southern Afghanistan to Pakistan, pro-
posed by an Argentinean oil company, rather than a rival route cham-
pioned by U.S. oil company Unocal. However, the region had become 
less stable in the aftermath of the war against the Soviets, even as the 
Taliban began to emerge as a power in Afghanistan in 1993. Rather 
than support a wider peace process in Afghanistan, Bhutto backed the 
Taliban, who she saw as a force that would provide security to protect 
the proposed pipeline and give stability to their country.

Her policy was influenced by the ISI, whose stature had risen during 
the Soviet occupation. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, 
the ISI sought to extend Pakistan’s regional control across Afghanistan 
and the Central Asian republics. The ISI began funding the Taliban 
(“students”), a Pashtun Islamic student movement in Kandahar. Using 
bribery, guerrilla tactics, and military support, the ISI helped install the 
Taliban as rulers in Kabul in 1996 and eventually extend its control 
over 95 percent of the country.

During the same time that the Bhutto government backed the Taliban 
in Afghanistan, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI), a strict religious party, 
began to gain power in Pakistan: Bhutto welcomed the party into her 
ruling coalition. Meanwhile the proxy war in Kashmir was heating up, 
again with government support. Thus, it was under Bhutto, and with 
her encouragement, that the Taliban rose to power in Afghanistan and 
the power of religious fundamentalists grew in Pakistan. Bhutto would 
come to regret these decisions. In a 1998 address Bhutto said that these 
policies had created a strategic threat to Pakistan and led to Islamic 
militancy, suicide bombings, weaponization of the population, the drug 
trade, and increased poverty and unemployment. And in an interview 
with the Council on Foreign Relations a few months before her death in 
2007, Bhutto said, “I remember when the Taliban first came up in neigh-
boring Afghanistan. Many of us, including our friends from the U.S.,

DEOBAND AND BARELWI SECTS

A variety of schools of Islamic thought, or sects, exist among 
Sunni Muslims on the subcontinent. In Pakistan, Deoband and 

Barelwi are the two primary sects. Deoband is a town 100 miles (160 
km) north of Delhi. A madrasa established there in 1867 became the 
headquarters for virulently anti-British Muslims who believed Western 
infl uence was corrupting Islam and who swore allegiance to religion 
over state. This became the model for other madrasas established 
throughout Pakistan after independence. Deoband is often linked to 
the spread of religious extremism, most notably as a seedbed for the 
Taliban in Afghanistan. To some degree this infl uence is real, as stu-
dents, or talibs, from these Deoband madrasas provided the grassroots 
strength that gave birth to the Taliban in 1996. However, the author-
ity inherent in the name Deoband is invoked to legitimize all kinds of 
Islamic conservatism; it is estimated some 15 percent of Pakistan’s 
Sunni Muslims consider themselves part of the Deoband movement.

The Bareiwi sect, to which some 60 percent of Pakistan’s Sunnis 
belong, was founded by a Sufi  scholar, Mullah Ahmad Raza Khan (1856–
1921), in the town of Barelwi in northern India. He is not related to 
the military and religious leader Sayyid Ahmad Barelwi (1786–1831). 
Ahmad Raza Khan taught that Islam is compatible with the subconti-
nent’s earlier religions, and Barelwis are apt to pray to holy men, or 
pirs, both living and dead. This practice is an abomination to orthodox 
Sunni Muslims, though Shi’i Muslims engage in similar rites.

initially thought they would bring peace to that war-torn country. And 
that was a critical, fatal mistake we made. If I had to do things again, 
that’s certainly not a decision that I would have taken” (Bhutto 2007).

Internal Feuds
Internal feuds had long been part of the Bhutto family legacy. Zulfikar 
Bhutto had feuded with family members as he rose to power. and his 
children followed in his footsteps. After Zulfikar’s death, Benazir fought 
with her mother, Begum Nusrat Bhutto (b. 1929), for control of the 
PPP. Nusrat favored Benazir’s brother, Mir Murtaza (1954–96), as heir 
to the Bhutto political mantle. Murtaza, meanwhile, went into exile in 
Kabul, Damascus, and Libya, and formed a militant breakaway PPP fac-
tion called al-Zulfikar Organization. From beyond Pakistan’s borders he

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

accused Benazir of betraying their father’s ideals. Murtaza also strongly 
opposed Benazir’s husband Ali Zardari’s involvement with the PPP, due 
to concerns about corruption.

Murtaza’s supporters had been implicated in violence, including the 
hijacking of a Pakistan International Airline aircraft as a display of pro-
test against the Zia regime, responsible for executing Murtaza’s father 
and their political leader.

In the 1993 election Mir Murtaza had won a seat as an anti-Bhutto 
candidate. When he returned from Damascus after years of exile, he 
was jailed on the longstanding terrorism charge. Benazir Bhutto also 
removed her mother from leadership in the PPP. The internecine 
conflict was perceived as another blot on Benazir Bhutto’s image. In 
September 1996 Mir Murtaza Bhutto was killed in a police ambush in 
Karachi with six companions. None of the police involved in the kill-
ing were arrested, and some were subsequently promoted. A judicial 
review of the killings concluded it could not have occurred without the 
approval from the highest levels of government.

Throughout the first half of the 1990s relations between Bhutto 
and Leghari deteriorated. Despite earlier pledges to revoke the Eighth 
Amendment, Leghari instead invoked it. On November 5, 1996, Leghari 

Benazir Bhutto’s policies were widely criticized and provoked large opposition rallies, such as 
the protest in this photo. (AP Photo/K. M. Choudary)

dismissed the Benazir Bhutto government, alleging crimes including cor-
ruption, mismanagement, and murder. The National Assembly was also 
dissolved. Bhutto’s husband, Asif Ali Zardari (b. 1956), who held the 
cabinet post of investment minister, was accused of taking bribes, receiv-
ing kickbacks on government contracts, and sponsoring extrajudicial 
killings in Karachi. Bhutto labeled the charges politically motivated and 
went into voluntary exile. She and her husband were tried in absentia in 
1999 and convicted. In 2001 the Supreme Court ordered a retrial. She 
was tried in a separate trial in absentia and convicted and sentenced to 
three years in prison. Facing arrest and incarceration if she returned to 
Pakistan, Bhutto remained in exile through the middle of the first decade 
of the new century. After Bhutto’s dismissal, Malik Meraj Khalid (r. 1996–
97), rector of the International Islamic University, was named caretaker 
prime minister. In the February 1997 elections the Pakistan Muslim 
League (PML) won a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly and 
Nawaz Sharif was reelected prime minister (r. 1997–99).

Nawaz Sharif ’s Second Government
Ever since the passage of the Eighth Amendment in 1985 during Zia 
ul-Haq’s regime, it had played havoc with Pakistan’s political stability. 
During his second term in office Sharif made overturning the Eighth 
Amendment a priority, and in April 1997, with the support of all the 
political parties, the Thirteenth Amendment to the constitution was 
adopted by the National Assembly. It gave the prime minister authority 
to repeal Article 58 (2)(b), the Eighth Amendment article that allowed 
the president to dismiss the prime minister and the National Assembly, 
thus restoring the original powers of the prime minister and returning 
the presidency to its ceremonial role. The Thirteenth Amendment also 
transferred the power to appoint the three chiefs of the armed forces 
and provincial governors from the president to the prime minister.

Nawaz Sharif also attempted to rein in the political practice of 
switching parties and alliances that had over the past few decades 
stalled progress and encouraged corruption. Because the parties and 
prime ministers depended on shaky coalitions to provide them with 
the majorities they needed to rule, politicians could threaten to aban-
don their party and shift their support to rival politicians. This was 
mostly done to win favors or gather power, rather than to promote the 
public’s agenda. Ministry posts, bank loans, and other benefits had been 
extracted by politicians as a price for continued party loyalty or for 
switching allegiances. Attempting to redress the problem, Nawaz Sharif

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

introduced the Anti-Defection Bill, which the Senate and National 
Assembly passed overwhelmingly in July as the Fourth Amendment.

Growing Repression
However, Sharif’s support for the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amend-
ments was accompanied by an increasingly autocratic political style, 
and thus many saw the amendments as part of his attempt to stifle 
opposition to his rule. Sharif arrested journalists who wrote critical arti-
cles about him, including respected figures Majam Sethi and Hussain 
Haqqani, and turned tax investigators on the editors who published 
their work. When the Supreme Court presided over a corruption case 
in which Nawaz Sharif was a defendant in 1997, his supporters attacked 
the court building, forcing proceedings to be suspended. No longer 
concerned about dismissal from his position, Nawaz Sharif let his rela-
tionship with President Leghari, his primary political foe, deteriorate. 
The chief justice of Pakistan, Syed Sajjad Ali Shah (served 1994–97), 
had become embroiled in judicial disagreements with the Sharif gov-
ernment, and Leghari threw his support behind Ali Shah. Sharif had 
party enforcers storm the Supreme Court in November and remove 
Chief Justice Ali Shah from office. Unable to dislodge him by dissolv-
ing the government, as he had with Benazir Bhutto, President Leghari 
resigned on December 2, 1997.

The new president would be indirectly elected by the two houses 
of Parliament, the National Assembly and the Senate, along with the 
four provincial assemblies. On December 31, 1997, the PML candidate, 
Muhammad Rafiq Tarar, a senator and former Supreme Court judge, 
was elected to replace Leghari, having beaten the PPP and Jamiat 
Ulema-i-Islam candidates by a 10-to-1 margin. The nation’s ninth presi-
dent, Tarar (r. 1998–2001) took office on January 1, 1998.

Nuclear Tests and the Economy
Early in May 1998 India’s new government under Prime Minister Atul 
Bihari Vajpayee (r. May–June 1996, 1998–2004), leader of the Hindu 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), tested a nuclear device, thereby con-
firming that it possessed nuclear weapons. Two weeks later, on May 
28, Pakistan conducted its own tests of five nuclear devices, with a 
reported yield of up to 40 kilotons, at a nuclear test facility at Chaghi, 
in Baluchistan. On the same day the Sharif government proclaimed an 
emergency, suspending basic rights and freezing all foreign-currency 
accounts in Pakistani banks. The nuclear tests brought international

condemnation, but Pakistan claimed it needed the weapons for self-
defense against India. The United Nations passed a unanimous resolu-
tion calling on both Pakistan and India to end their nuclear weapons 
programs, and UN secretary-general Kofi Annan (r. 1997–2007) urged 
both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Pakistan 
expressed willingness to sign the treaty if India did the same, but India 
declined. In June 1998, Pakistan declared a moratorium on future test-
ing and India made a similar declaration.

By the time of the 1998 nuclear tests, Pakistan’s nuclear program 
(both military and domestic) had been functioning for more than two 
decades with assistance from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, 
the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), France, and China. 
The United States’s response to Pakistan’s nuclear program during this 
period swung between cutting off foreign aid to reinstituting assistance. 
Following Pakistan’s nuclear tests of late May and early June 1998, 
the United States reimposed sanctions (excluding humanitarian assis-
tance), which had been eased in 1995, against Pakistan. The U.S. sanc-
tions included a “ban on financing from the Trade and Development 
Agency, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Export-
Import Bank, restrictions on U.S. exports of high-technology products, 
opposition to loans from international financial institutions, and a ban 
on U.S. bank loans to the government of Pakistan.” Japan joined the 
United States, freezing most of its development aid to Pakistan and 
withdrawing support for new loans for Pakistan in international bodies 
(Peterson Institute, 2007).

The nuclear tests temporarily bolstered Prime Minister Sharif’s popu-
larity among Pakistanis, despite the fact that the effects of the sanctions 
on Pakistan’s economy were felt immediately and that he had earlier 
declared a state of emergency curtailing human rights. Nevertheless, 
Pakistan’s fragile economy, buffeted since the beginning of the 1990s, 
faced potential collapse. The Sharif government had to negotiate bank 
loans in July 1998 to cover the budgetary shortfall caused by the sanc-
tions, while increasing the price of nondiesel gasoline. That same 
month Standard and Poor’s downgraded Pakistan’s rating, predicting 
imminent bankruptcy.

Although some of the restrictions against Pakistan were eased by the 
end of the year and in early 1999, Nawaz Sharif’s hold on power grew 
ever more precarious. The poor economic situation was but one factor. 
Since the death of Zia, the military had been an ever-present threat to 
Pakistan’s feeble democracy. Furthermore, “Sharif had to look over his 
other shoulder . . . at the militant Islamists who were a powerful force

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

in Pakistan” (Talbott 2004, 107). The latter were given support by the 
neighboring Taliban in Afghanistan, even as a cash-strapped Pakistan 
provided financial aid to the Taliban government in 1998. Sharif exac-
erbated Islamists’ fears (and conservative concerns) when he canceled 
the traditional Friday holidays. But the failure of his economic program 
during a period of worldwide economic growth and, especially, his 
attempt to exert control over the military would ultimately lead to his 
undoing.

After the army chief of staff, Jehangir Karamat, suggested that the 
military leadership be given a role in the National Security Council of 
Pakistan, Sharif forced his resignation in early October. Karamat had 
warned that Pakistan was facing grave problems, namely, an economy 
that was on the brink of collapse. He said Pakistan “could not afford the 
destabilizing effects of polarization, vendettas, and insecurity-expedi-
ent policies” (quoted in Abbas 2004, 166). He was replaced by General 
Pervez Musharraf (b. 1943).

To strengthen his hold on power, Nawaz Sharif oversaw passage of 
the 15th Amendment of the constitution in the National Assembly in 
late October. Once passed by the Senate, it would have made sharia the 
supreme law of Pakistan and given the prime minister the unfettered 
right to rule by degree in the name of Islamic law. But unsure of the 
level of support in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority was needed 
for passage, Nawaz Sharif never brought the legislation for a vote 
within the 90 days required for ratification.

The Kargil Conflict
After the two countries tested nuclear devices, tensions between India 
and Pakistan steadily increased. In February 1999 Sharif and Vajpayee 
attempted to de-escalate the situation. Vajpayee traveled to Lahore 
by bus and was met by Sharif at the Wagah border crossing on the 
Grand Trunk Road. The two leaders issued the Lahore Declaration, 
defining the measures the countries would each take to stabilize rela-
tions. The religious party Jamaat-i-Islami, a partner in Sharif’s coali-
tion government, opposed the visit, but all other political groups 
welcomed the effort to promote peace between Pakistan and India. 
However, Kashmir remained a flashpoint between Pakistan and India, 
ever threatening to plunge the two countries back into war. India had 
refused to hold the plebiscite mandated by a UN Security Council reso-
lution in 1948, and Muslim Kashmiri fighters, supported by Pakistan, 
continued their battle against Indian occupation forces. The fighters

infiltrated Indian-controlled Kashmir and attacked symbols of Indian 
rule, including army posts and police stations. In response the Indian 
army established border posts along the Line of Control to combat the 
attacks. Because of the high altitude of these posts—from about 12,000 
to more than 15,000 feet (4,000–5,200 m)—troops were withdrawn 
during the winter.

In April 1999, before Indian troops returned to their high-altitude 
garrisons, Kashmiri guerrillas captured posts along mountain ridges 
near the Indian-occupied towns of Kargil and Drass. From their posi-
tions the guerrillas launched artillery fire on National Highway 1, 
which runs north from Kashmir’s capital, Srinagar. Pakistan denied 
any knowledge of or support for the guerrilla action. But India claimed 
identification taken from slain guerrillas revealed they were members of 
Pakistan’s Northern Light Infantry, a paramilitary force under Pakistan’s 
control. Beginning in May Indian forces counterattacked in what was 
to become the first land war in history between two declared nuclear 
powers. Two of its aircraft strayed into Pakistani territory, one of which 
was shot down. The potential for a nuclear confrontation caused 
worldwide concern. As the fighting continued from May into July, and 
the Pakistani forces were slowly pushed back, U.S. president Clinton 
helped persuade Pakistan to use its influence with the guerrillas to stop 
fighting. Bowing to international pressure, Sharif withdrew all Pakistani 
troops from Indian-held territory to the Line of Control. The guerrillas 
left the captured territory by August 1999. The withdrawal of Pakistani 
forces further increased Sharif’s unpopularity at home.

The Coup against Sharif
The object of increasingly unflattering media coverage, Nawaz Sharif 
attempted to intimidate the press. In May 1999 Nawaz Sharif’s secret 
police invaded the home of a leading journalist and critic of the regime, 
Najam Sethi, and assaulted and kidnapped him. An international protest 
forced Sharif to release the journalist. Signs of public disenchantment 
with the entire political process grew. In the four national elections held 
from 1988 to 1997, voter turnout had dropped progressively, from 43 
percent in 1988 to 35 percent by 1997.

The military remained the one state institution Nawaz Sharif had 
not brought under his control. Karamat’s departure in late 1998 had 
provoked great resentment in the military, placing Nawaz Sharif in a 
vulnerable position. As mass opposition rallies were staged against his 
government, Sharif, worried about the potential for a coup, planned

to replace Musharraf, a veteran of both the 1965 and 1971 wars with 
India, with a more compliant official. On October 12, 1999, General 
Musharraf was on a commercial flight to Karachi, returning from a 
visit to Colombo, Sri Lanka, one of 198 passengers. According to a 
police report filed by a colonel in the army, Nawaz Sharif ordered the 
Civil Aviation Authority to deny the flight permission to land any-
where in Pakistan. This became known as the “Plane Conspiracy” 
case. Simultaneously, Nawaz Sharif announced he was appointing the 
director of the ISI, Pakistan’s intelligence service, as the military’s new 
chief of staff. The military refused to recognize the appointment and 
took over Karachi airport, allowing Musharraf’s flight to land with only 
minutes of fuel left onboard. Once on the ground, General Musharraf 
ordered the military to take control of the government, claiming the 
turmoil and uncertainty gripping the nation necessitated the action. 
Musharraf proclaimed himself the chief executive of Pakistan. The 
Thirteenth Amendment had proven insufficient to protect democracy, 
however flawed the democratic system may have been. Although 
Musharraf did not declare martial law, as had been done in previous 
military takeovers, Pakistan was once more under military rule.

A RETURN TO THE WORLD 

STAGE (1999–2008)

General Pervez Musharraf’s 1999 coup demonstrated that constitu-
tional safeguards could not protect the civilian government from 

military takeover. Musharraf, who took the title of chief executive at the 
time of the coup, later removed President Muhammad Rafiq Tarar from 
office and installed himself as president.

From the time of the takeover Musharraf faced international pressure 
to restore democracy. But priorities changed in the wake of the attacks 
of September 11, 2001, in the United States. Across Pakistan’s border 
in Afghanistan the ruling Taliban were shielding the putative architect 
of the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden (b. 1957). Pakistan, which had 
helped foment radical and militant Islam, as had the United States dur-
ing the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, was once more the linchpin 
in a global struggle. Musharraf gained economic and military assistance 
in exchange for Pakistan’s partnership in the U.S.-led War on Terror. But 
Musharraf faced bitter opposition to the alliance from Pakistanis who 
did not want to see fellow Muslims branded as enemies or terrorists. 
Meanwhile, violence wrought by Sunni and Shi’i religious extremists 
fanned divisions within Pakistan’s Muslim community. Yet there were 
hopeful signs for the nation’s future as well. Relations between Pakistan 
and India eased, and progress on the Kashmir issue was made.

However, Musharraf’s autocratic style led to wide dissatisfaction 
across the political spectrum. In 2007, in an effort to shore up sup-
port after eight years in power, he announced elections would be held; 
he allowed former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, 
both exiles, to return and stand for election. Bhutto was assassinated 
soon after returning to Pakistan, but her party won the elections held 
in February 2008. With a coalition civilian government leading them, 
the citizens of Pakistan once more attempted to create a working

democratic state respectful of both cultural traditions and individual 
freedom.

Musharraf ’s Coup d’État
On October 12, 1999, after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to 
bar General Musharraf’s commercial flight from landing in Pakistan, 
Musharraf staged a coup and took control of the government. He took 
immediate steps to consolidate his power: Nawaz Sharif; his brother 
Shabaz Sharif, the former chief minister of Punjab (r. 1997–99); and 
five other officials were arrested. They were charged with hijacking, 
kidnapping, and attempted murder, as the plane was running low 
on fuel and the refusal to allow it to land endangered the lives of all 
onboard. The coup was criticized by the international community for 
short-circuiting the democratic process; the United States stressed the 
need to restore civilian rule as quickly as possible.

In the aftermath of the October coup, police and paramilitary and 
military personnel detained scores of leaders and activists of opposi-

tion political parties, according 
to Human Rights Watch. The 
arrests were made under laws 
governing sedition and the main-
tenance of public order. Figures 
including Rama Sanaullah 
Khan, from the Punjab provin-
cial assembly, and PML lead-
ers Kulsoom Nawaz. Mamnoon 
Hussain, Shah Mohammad Shah, 
and Haleem Siddiqui were among 
those arrested and in some cases 
beaten and tortured.

The case against Nawaz Sharif 
was brought before an antiter-
rorism court in Karachi. Found 
guilty of corruption, hijacking, 
tax evasion, embezzlement, and 
terrorism he was sentenced to

million rupees (about $8 million) and not seek public office for 21 
years. He moved to Saudi Arabia.

The Musharraf camp took the absence of large street protests against 
Nawaz Sharif’s deportation as an indication that average Pakistanis had 
become disengaged from politics. Soon after the deportation, the U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs, Christina 
Rocca (served 2001–06), visited Pakistan. Although she expressed con-
cern about the police crackdown on Nawaz Sharif’s political party, she 
reaffirmed U.S. support for General Musharraf’s rule.

On May 12, 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that Musharraf’s coup was 
valid. Though the court found the takeover represented a constitutional 
deviation, the judges found military intervention had been undertaken 
as a necessity, the only way to bring about economic reforms and halt 
corruption. The court directed Musharraf to hold general elections by 
October 2002.

Economic Reforms
Musharraf had come to power promising economic reforms and effec-
tive steps against corruption. The bar for economic growth was not 
set high for Musharraf. During the 1990s the growth rate in national 
income had dropped to less than 4 percent annually from more than 
6 percent annually in the 1980s, due to government mismanagement 
and the economic sanctions imposed in response to Pakistan’s nuclear-
weapons program. Industrial growth rates dropped almost by half, from 
8.2 percent to 4.8 percent annually during the decade. The percentage 
of households living in absolute poverty increased from 21.4 percent in 
1990–91 to 40 percent in 2000–01. Corruption had brought the gears 
of government to near standstill.

Musharraf made economic development an early priority. He courted 
international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF. 
Loans were used to invest in communications, energy, water supply, and 
railway infrastructure and highways and ports. For the first three years 
of his rule the economy remained stagnant before per capita income 
began to rise. The economy was kept from expanding too rapidly by 
following the IMF’s model of economic stabilization.

Efforts at Religious Reform
Musharraf was a secular Muslim and a modernist. In an interview 
shortly after the coup his father Syed Musharraf-ud-Din, a career 
diplomat, was asked if Pervez prayed five times a day. “If the father

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

doesn’t, I don’t see why the son should,” he answered (quoted from 
Jones 2002, 19). In his first major policy address, in October 1999, 
Pervez Musharraf issued a challenge to demagogues exploiting reli-
gion. “Islam teaches tolerance not hatred; universal brotherhood and 
not enmity; peace and not violence; progress and not bigotry. I have 
great respect for the Ulema and expect them to come forth and present 
Islam in its true light. I urge them to curb elements which are exploit-
ing religion for vested interests and bring a bad name to our faith” 
(Musharraf 1999). But his efforts to curtail religious extremism had 
little effect. Musharraf tried to reform the antiblasphemy law, which 
declared that speaking against the prophet Muhammad or desecrating 
the Qur’an a capital crime. The law was open to abuse, for any dis-
gruntled individual could accuse someone of blasphemy, and by law 
the accused would be imprisoned before an investigation occurred. 
Musharraf sought to have the law amended to require a preliminary 
investigation before an arrest. In a sign of how strong the influence 
of the religious conservatives had become, in May 2000 Musharraf 
announced an end to his effort to reform the law. Religious parties had 
threatened demonstrations and a general strike.

Likewise, efforts to disarm the public were announced with great fan-
fare. Musharraf announced a ban on the public display of weapons in 
February 2001, but the law went unenforced. At rallies religious leaders 
were still protected by gun-toting bodyguards who went unchallenged 
by government or military authorities.

Government Reforms
On June 20, 2001, Musharraf removed Rafiq Tarar as president under 
the provisional constitutional order, which dissolved the already sus-
pended Senate, and the national and provincial assemblies. Musharraf 
took the title of president for himself.

In August he introduced the Local Government System. The stated 
purpose was to give individuals at the grassroots level more say in 
local government. The system restructured governance by transferring 
authority previously exercised by provincial administrators down to 
the district and local level. The system was intended to create more 
responsive local governments and to decentralize the state’s administra-
tive power. Meanwhile, with Musharraf serving as both president and 
army chief of staff in combination with the crackdowns on opposition 
parties, political power became more centralized at the apex of the 
government.

A RETURN TO THE WORLD STAGE

The system created a three-tier structure consisting of the union, or 
local council; the tehsil council; and the district, or zilla council. The 
country would be divided into 105 zillas, or districts. Each zilla would 
be subdivided into tehsils, corresponding roughly to large counties, 
and tehsils themselves would consist of local, or union jurisdictions. 
Citizens would gain control through representatives they elected to 
these councils.

Harking back to the Basic Democracies System of Ayub Khan, rep-
resentatives would be chosen in direct, nonparty elections; the rep-
resentatives in turn would vote for provincial and national assembly 
members. One-third of the seats were reserved for women. The voting 
age was lowered from 21 to 18 years of age.

Foreign Policy and the Events of September 11
During his first two years in power Musharraf sought to bolster his 
image and support within Pakistan by taking the traditional position 
regarding India and expressing support for the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
The former position upheld his popularity with his main base of sup-
port, the military, while the latter placed him in good standing with the 
Islamists. He also had to reposition himself with the West, which was 
dismayed at yet another military coup in Pakistan.

His policy toward India was marked by tacit support of the Kashmir 
uprising—as army chief of staff under Prime Minister Sharif he had 
been responsible for the 1999 Kargil invasion. That the insurgency had 
ties to the Taliban seemingly caused Pakistan to play a proxy role in the 
province for its neighbor. In fact, “before 11 September he [Musharraf] 
had consistently supported Mullah Mohammed Omar’s Kandahar 
regime. This was not because he sympathized with the Taliban’s inter-
pretation of Islam . . . but because he believed the Taliban served 
Pakistan’s regional interests” (Bennett Jones 2002, 2). Under Musharraf 
Pakistan not only supported the Kashmir uprising but infiltrated man-
power into the region. The overall effect of this for Musharraf was to 
placate his Islamist critics.

Yet, in July 2001 Musharraf met with Indian prime minister Atal 
Behari Vajpayee (r. 1996, 1998–2004) at Agra, India, to pursue a settle-
ment on the Kashmir issue. At the Agra Summit the leaders also dis-
cussed reducing the risk of nuclear confrontation, closer commercial 
ties, and freeing of prisoners of war. But a solution to the Kashmir 
dispute continued to elude the leaders, and the meetings collapsed. 
Nonetheless, the two expressed the need to forge a peaceful relation-

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

ship, rejecting the venom of the past, and tensions between the two 
nations were eased by the meetings. However, on December 13, 2001, 
the relationship took a turn for the worse. Pakistani terrorists disguised 
as tourists planned to attack the Indian parliament and hold the legisla-
tors hostage until they agreed to settle the Kashmir dispute. But security 
stopped their explosives-laden car from entering the compound; the 
terrorists were killed in an ensuing gunfight. The Pakistani government 
denied involvement, but in reaction Vajpayee ordered the Indian army to 
deploy on Pakistan’s border, and the Indian navy sailed within striking 
distance of Karachi. Pakistan’s ambassador to the United Nations threat-
ened a nuclear response to an attack. The United States, eager to diffuse 
the crisis, broke into the Indian navy’s communication system and sent a 
false message instructing the four warships to withdraw from the harbor 
(Sud, n.p.). Meanwhile, U.S. officials pressured the Indian government 
to pull back its forces from the border.

During 2000 and the first half of 2001 Musharraf’s policy toward the 
United States focused on getting the sanctions lifted or, at the very least, 
the money returned that Pakistan had already paid for the undelivered 
fighter jets while employing his regional strategy. He managed to score 
a coup when President Bill Clinton came to Pakistan for a brief visit in 
March 2000 (and spoke for 15 minutes on Pakistani television), which 
caused anxiety in New Delhi—exactly what Musharraf had wanted. 
Clinton not only urged Musharraf to reinstate the democratic institutions 
of Pakistan’s government, he also pushed for a settlement of the Kashmir 
conflict and assistance with getting the Taliban to turn over Osama bin 
Laden, whom the United States held responsible for two attacks against 
U.S. embassies in 1998. Of these three points, the only one Musharraf 
agreed to was the one in which he had no power to effect the outcome. 
He promised to intervene with the Taliban on behalf of U.S. interests, but 
as he later admitted in his memoirs, “After the Taliban came to power, 
we lost much of the leverage we had with them” (Musharraf 2006, 203). 
Musharraf simply rebuffed Clinton, who, as a lame-duck president, had 
little leverage during his final months in office.

In June 2001 the Bush administration reiterated the same three 
points to Pakistani foreign minister Abdul Sattar during his visit to 
Washington, D.C. Islamabad noted that Washington was prepared 
to take a tougher stance if these points were not acted upon, but the 
events of September 11 altered the dynamic of the region and once 
again brought Pakistan into a close alliance with the United States.

Within hours of the attacks the U.S. government concluded that they 
probably had been planned by Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, where

A RETURN TO THE WORLD STAGE

he had been given sanctuary by the Taliban. Any military reprisal would 
require Pakistan’s cooperation.

Until the events of September 11 Musharraf had continued the 
Central Asia policy of his predecessors. He supported the Taliban 
government in Afghanistan, seeking stability in the region, improved 
access to Central Asia, and an ally in Kashmir against India. And since 
most Taliban were Pashtuns, they had a kinship with Pakistan’s popu-
lation along the border, which fostered friendly relations between the 
two nations. However, on September 12 Pakistani diplomats were given 
a choice by the U.S. government, delivered by U.S. deputy secretary 
of state Richard Armitage (served 2001–06): Pakistan could either 
support the Taliban, or it could support the United States. General 
Musharraf chose to join the United States in its War on Terror. He knew 
his decision would face opposition from fundamentalist elements who 
supported the Taliban and opposed the United States for its stanch sup-
port for Israel and perceived anti-Islamic agenda. But Musharraf was a 
pragmatist and realist. Pakistan could not withstand the economic and 
military pressure and power of the United States if he refused to accede 
to its demands. Conversely, if he agreed, Pakistan stood to gain sub-
stantial benefits in terms of economic and military assistance, as well 
as power and prestige on the world stage.

On September 14 Musharraf informed the army command of his 
decision. Musharraf reassigned some pro-Taliban senior army officers 
and retired others. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks. Pakistan 
assisted in unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading the Taliban 
to turn over or deport bin Laden. On September 19 Musharraf spoke 
to the nation in a televised address and explained his decision to the 
citizens. He said that only a small, vocal minority opposed his decision. 
But Pakistan was already awash in anti-American feelings. Though 
Musharraf gained the stature of an international statesman for joining 
the War on Terror, at home demonstrations against Musharraf and the 
United States were staged in Quetta, Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar, and 
other cities.

In a matter of days after the attacks, the United States was permit-
ted to use four air bases in Pakistan for support, rather than offensive, 
operations. Pakistan also allowed use of its airspace for overflights 
of military aircraft engaged in combat operations. In return Pakistan 
received some $600 million per year in aid, and $3 billion in loans was 
forgiven. The United States and coalition partners launched Operation 
Enduring Freedom to invade Afghanistan, remove the Taliban from 
power, and capture Osama bin Laden. Within two months the operation

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

had driven the Taliban from power, though bin Laden eluded capture. 
In the aftermath of the U.S. campaign bin Laden was believed to have 
fled to Waziristan, in Pakistan’s tribal areas. The U.S. war in Afghanistan 
caused another refugee crisis for Pakistan, as tens of thousands seeking 
safety fled over the Pakistan border.

Now fully vested in the situation in Pakistan, U.S. secretary of state 
Colin Powell (served 2001–06) traveled there in January 2002, fol-
lowing the crisis caused by the attempted terrorist attack on India’s 
parliament. Powell made all future military and economic assistance 
contingent upon Pakistan divulging the location of its nuclear weap-
ons, which Pakistan reluctantly agreed to do. U.S. and British firms 
built a command and control system to ensure that the nuclear weap-
ons were secured. Pakistan also agreed to de-mate its nuclear core from 
the trigger mechanism and store the two separately, as was the practice 
in India and other nuclear powers. As a reward the United States pro-
vided Pakistan with an additional $1.2 billion in economic aid, and 
additional military equipment to aid the search for Osama bin Laden. 
The United States also used the crisis provoked by the attack on India’s 
parliament to demand that Pakistan crack down on the rogue nuclear 
scientist Abdul Qadeer (A. Q.) Khan (b. 1936), regarded as the father of 
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program. Pakistan placed him under house 
arrest. A subsequent U.S. investigation discovered that a network cre-
ated by Khan and the Pakistani military had funneled nuclear weapons 
technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. The investigation also 
revealed that Pakistan’s nuclear weapon was an exact copy of a U.S. 
nuclear weapon from the 1980s. The United States suspected China as 
the source of the design, and, concerned that its own nuclear program 
had been compromised, the government overhauled security at nuclear 
weapons installations.

Nuclear Proliferation
In September 2004 the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy 
Agency reported that as early as 1995 Pakistan was providing Iran 
with the designs for sophisticated centrifuges capable of making bomb-
grade nuclear fuel. In November a CIA report said the arms-traffick-
ing network led by A. Q. Khan provided Iran’s nuclear program with 
significant assistance, including the designs for advanced and efficient 
weapons components. George Tenet (served 1997–2004), the former 
director of the Central Intelligence Agency, described Khan as being “at 
least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden” because of his role in providing

A RETURN TO THE WORLD STAGE

nuclear technology to other countries (Rabman, B., 2). Khan remains in 
Pakistan, where he was pardoned in 2003 by Musharraf. In September 
2005 Musharraf stated that after two years of interrogations, investiga-
tors had been unable to learn if Khan had passed along designs for a 
Chinese nuclear weapon to North Korea and Iran. However, he said 
Khan had likely exported about a dozen centrifuges to North Korea to 
produce nuclear weapons.

Referendum on Musharraf
Seeking more legitimacy for his continued rule, Musharraf scheduled 
a referendum on his presidency for April 2002. The sole question on 
the referendum was “For the survival of the local government system, 
establishment of democracy, continuity of reforms, end to sectarianism 
and extremism, and to fulfill the vision of Quaid-i-Azam [the “Great 
Leader,” referring to Pakistan’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah], would 
you like to elect President General Pervez Musharraf as President of 
Pakistan for five years?”

However, the constitution mandated the president be elected by mem-
bers of the Senate and the national and provincial assemblies—which 
had been suspended in June 2001—making the referendum illegal in the 
view of many, including the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy 
(ARD), a coalition of 15 political parties headed by the Pakistan People’s 
Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML). The ARD, formed 
in the aftermath of Musharraf’s 1999 coup, urged voters to boycott the 
election and organized demonstrations against it. However, an attempt 
by the opposition to halt the referendum was rejected by the Supreme 
Court. After the vote the government claimed that about 70 percent 
of the 78 million eligible voters had participated in the referendum 
and that 98 percent had voted in favor of an extension of Musharraf’s 
presidency, but according to Human Rights Watch by most accounts the 
vote was rigged and the numbers grossly inflated (Human Rights Watch 
2002). In preparation for the October 2002 general election Musharraf 
issued the Legal Framework Order of 2002 in August. Its stated pur-
pose was to give the president the power to make laws as necessary to 
facilitate the general elections. Yet it also gave the president the power to 
dismiss the prime minister and dissolve Parliament, much as the Eighth 
Amendment to the constitution had before it was rescinded. Opposition 
parties viewed the framework order as illegal and unconstitutional and 
refused to recognize Musharraf’s dual roles as head of the military and 
head of state. As the election approached, the Islamic parties, which

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

had formed a coalition called the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA, or 
United Council of Action), tried to exploit the public’s unhappiness with 
Pakistan’s support for the U.S.-led War on Terror. Up until the October 
2002 election the combined results for all religious parties together had 
never exceeded 7 percent of the vote; in the October election the MMA 
drew unexpectedly large support, becoming the third largest party in 
the national parliament. The coalition also won an absolute majority 
in the provincial assembly of NWFP, and formed the largest party in 
the provincial assembly in Baluchistan. Despite the impressive gains of 
the MMA, no political party won an absolute majority. The party that 
Musharraf had endorsed, the Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-e-Azam 
(PML-Q), won a plurality with 34.5 percent of the vote, and the PPP 
came in second with 23.7 percent. In November Parliament and provin-
cial assemblies elected Zafarullah Khan Jamali (r. 2002–04) of the PML-
Q as prime minister, and Musharraf gave up the title of chief executive. 
Jamali affirmed Pakistan’s support for the War on Tenor.

Musharraf ’s War on Terror
Though the government threw its support behind the War on Terror, 
Pakistan remained a haven for terrorist activity, as it had been well 
before 9/11. The madrasas run by fundamentalist clerics inculcated 
youngsters with lessons in jihad and anti-Western attitudes. In 1993 
a Pakistani had come to the United States and murdered two CIA 
employees and wounded three others in an attack outside of CIA head-
quarters in Virginia. That same year Ramzi Yousef (b. 1967) traveled to 
the United States and helped orchestrate the first bombing of the World 
Trade Center in New York, where six died and some 1,000 were injured. 
He fled to Southeast Asia where he conducted a bombing in Cebu City 
in the Philippines and aboard a Philippine airliner, which killed one 
passenger, and was arrested in Islamabad in 1995 while planning to 
carry out simultaneous bombings of 11 U.S. airliners. Two U.S. diplo-
mats were shot to death by militants in Karachi in 1995, and two years 
later four U.S. businessmen were shot to death by militants in that same 
city. In the post-9/l1 world the threat was exemplified by the abduction 
and subsequent beheading in Pakistan of a U.S. reporter for the Wall 
Street Journal, Daniel Pearl (1963–2002), in February 2002. Three of 
the four suspected principals in the 2005 terrorist bombings in London 
that killed 55 had visited Pakistan the previous year.

In March 2003 Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (b. ca. 1964), the former 
head of al-Qaeda operations, linked to both Ramzi Yousef and the

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Daniel Pearl murder, was arrested in Pakistan. Five army officers with 
possible ties to Mohammed were put in military detention as part of 
the investigation. The links between the military and terrorists and 
religious extremists aroused concern about the loyalties of the armed 
forces. Musharraf himself survived assassination attempts and planned 
attacks, several of which involved members of the military officer corps. 
In December 2003 he survived two attacks while traveling by car, and 
other planned attacks were reportedly uncovered and stopped.

Despite these assassination attempts Musharraf stayed the course. 
He was rewarded for his efforts with economic and military assistance 
from the United States, including an end to U.S. economic sanctions, 
an increase in foreign aid, and the waiver or payment rescheduling of 
more than one-third of Pakistan’s external debt. Direct foreign invest-
ment increased after 9/11 as well. Cash inflows enabled the government 
to balance its books, increase economic growth, and procure weapons. 
Internal revenue collection also improved, reducing deficits. Inflation, 
which had been running in double digits, declined. But some reforms 
were complicated by the events of 9/11. Almost half of Pakistan’s GNP 
and most of its export earnings come from the agricultural sector, 
controlled by a few thousand feudal families. In February 2000 the 
government had announced plans for a massive land-reform program 
to end feudalism and the power of landed families. That October the 
government had issued a report calling for rapid land redistribution to 
empower landless peasants. But no action was taken at the time, and 
after Musharraf allied Pakistan with the West—an unpopular decision 
among many Pakistanis—he needed all the support he could get, and 
could not afford to antagonize the powerful feudal families. At the 
same time, many U.S. officials continued to doubt Musharraf’s commit-
ment to the War on Terror. In 2003 Musharraf dispatched some 70,000 
to 80,000 troops to NWFP, FATA, and Baluchistan. Trained to battle 
Indian troops on open plains, the troops were poorly prepared and 
equipped for mountain warfare and sustained heavy initial casualties. 
Tribal leaders were paid to end the fighting. After the U.S. elections in 
November 2003, the Bush administration gave Pakistan another $1 bil-
lion in military aid, including P-3C Orion surveillance aircraft, Phalanx 
weapons systems for naval ships, and 2,000 Tow antitank missiles. The 
CIA opened clandestine bases in Pakistan in late 2003 to search for bin 
Laden, but claimed its operations were hampered by the oversight and 
policies of Pakistan. Pakistani officials claimed supervision was needed 
for the Americans’ safety, as they were unpopular and immediately 
identifiable. Whatever the level of cooperation, the Musharraf govern-

ment was reluctant to flaunt its support for the United States because 
of hostility to the United States in the tribal areas and among Islamic 
militants. The Pakistani government had long been resented in the 
region for both its interference and its neglect.

Since the October 2002 elections the dispute over the validity of the 
Legal Framework Order (LFO) of 2002 had remained unresolved, leading 
to a legislative stalemate. In December 2003 Musharraf was able to gain 
the support of the MMA, the alliance of religious parties, in part by tem-
pering his support for secularization initiatives such as efforts to roll back 
Hudood laws that the MMA wanted to keep in place. And in the run-up 
to the general elections of 2002, Musharraf created arbitrary educational 
qualifications for holding public office to disqualify members of moderate 
parties, while recognizing degrees from madrasas, so fundamentalist can-
didates could run unimpeded. With the MMA in Musharraf’s legislative 
camp, he now had the two-thirds majority required to adopt the LFO. 
Prosperity helped dampen dissent. Spurred by the end of the United 
States’s foreign-aid embargo, Pakistan’s GDP had increased by 6.4 percent 
in 2003/4, well above the target 5.3 percent. That December, by legisla-
tive vote, the Legal Framework Order of 2002 became the Seventeenth 
Amendment of the constitution. Musharraf promised to relinquish on 
January 1, 2004, some of the authority and powers he had exercised since 
the coup, and he agreed to give up his military position on December 31, 
2004. In return Musharraf received a vote of confidence from Parliament 
and the four provincial assemblies, and his five-year term ending in 2007 
was endorsed. However, the opposition boycotted the vote, though they 
did not try to block the confidence vote itself from taking place. The 
Seventeenth Amendment also indemnified Musharraf for any actions 
undertaken since the coup of October 12, 1999.

With this new endorsement in hand Musharraf continued to crack 
down on militants. In June 2004 Pakistani troops attacked suspected 
al-Qaeda hideouts and a training facility in a tribal region near the town 
of Shakai in South Waziristan. Tension had grown in South Waziristan 
in the preceding month as authorities pressured tribesmen to evict 
hundreds of Central Asian, Arab, and Afghan militants, many of whom 
moved there from Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban regime in 
late 2001. The militants refused to surrender and register with authori-
ties despite a government offer of amnesty allowing them to settle in 
Pakistan if they renounced terrorism. The army eventually deployed 
25,000 troops in South Waziristan.

Meanwhile, the international community accused Pakistan of con-
tinuing to harbor and finance Afghani Islamic militants. In August

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

2004, President Musharraf vowed that Pakistan would not allow Islamic 
militants from Afghanistan and now living in Pakistan to disrupt elec-
tions in Afghanistan. But diplomats familiar with the border region 
claimed Pakistan had been training, funding, and organizing such 
elements. Diplomats said militant training operations in Baluchistan 
were so extensive that it was not possible for the ISI to be ignorant of 
the activity. In September and October Pakistani air and ground forces 
attacked several suspected training bases in NWFP and tribal areas near 
the Afghan border. Hundreds of militants, soldiers, and civilians were 
reportedly killed.

Political Repression
Whatever lip service the Musharraf regime paid to restoring democracy, 
its actions served to stifle dissent. In 2003 Pakistani officials arrested 
Javed Hashmi (b. 1948), a leader of the Alliance for the Restoration of 
Democracy and provisional head of the PML. Accused of urging army 
officers to rebel against General Musharraf, Hashmi was sentenced to 
seven years in prison. In April 2004 he was sentenced to 23 years in 
prison on sedition charges after a closed trial. In May Shahbaz Sharif, 
former chief minister of Punjab and brother of former prime minister 
Nawaz Sharif, was deported upon his arrival in Pakistan following three 
years in exile. Hundreds of PML followers were reportedly arrested. The 
Supreme Court had ruled in April that Shahbaz Sharif had the right to 
return to defend himself in court against charges that included extraju-
dicial killings—executions carried out by police, state agents, or other 
authorities without permission of courts or legal authority—while in 
office. But the government claimed a secret agreement prevented family 
members of the deposed prime minister from returning for a decade. 
Shahbaz Sharif maintained no such agreement existed. At the time of 
his arrival in Lahore, cellular phone service was blocked throughout 
the city.

Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali resigned on June 26, 2004, 
without offering an explanation. Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain of the PML-
Q was appointed caretaker prime minister (r. June–Aug. 2004) until 
Parliament chose Shaukat Aziz, the minister of finance who had super-
vised the recent economic recovery, as prime minister (r. 2004–07).

In November 2004 Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of former prime 
minister Benazir Bhutto, who had been in jail for eight years awaiting 
trial on murder and corruption charges, was released on bail. Zardari 
criticized Musharraf and called for free elections. He was rearrested in

A RETURN TO THE WORLD STAGE

late December while preparing to fly to Islamabad to address a politi-
cal rally. At the same time hundreds of armed police officers set up 
barricades to prevent members of Ms. Bhutto’s political party from 
going to the airport or attending the rally. After word of Zardari’s 
arrest spread, supporters clashed with the police, smashing windows 
as the police fired tear gas and carried out baton charges. Zardari’s 
arrest came days after General Musharraf confirmed in a Pakistani TV 
interview that he was withdrawing his promise to step down as army 
chief and become the country’s civilian president by the end of 2004. 
He said that for the sake of the country’s stability he would continue 
to hold both posts, which gave him sweeping powers, until elections 
scheduled for 2007.

In December 2004 U.S. president George W. Bush (r. 2001–09) 
praised General Musharraf after meeting him in Washington, D.C., call-
ing him a crucial ally in the War on Terror and a force for democracy in 
Pakistan. American support helped encourage Musharraf to deal with 
domestic opposition as he chose. With the leaders of the two main 
opposition parties in exile—Nawaz Sharif in Saudi Arabia and Benazir 
Bhutto in London—his chief critics had been neutralized.

Factional and Religious Violence
Political, sectarian, and criminal violence increased throughout Pakistan 
during the Musharraf years, a tragedy exemplified by the assassination 
of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007. During 
2007, an average of one suicide bomb per week was detonated in 
Pakistan. The violence was caused in part by a lack of state authority 
combined with the power of local insurrectionist groups. In 2007 vio-
lence associated with terrorist activities was estimated to have cost the 
lives of more than 1,500 civilians, and almost 600 security personnel 
and 1,500 insurgents. This was more than double the total of the previ-
ous year, and a remarkable increase over the 189 total such fatalities 
recorded in 2003. Not surprisingly, the problem of violence associated 
with terrorism was worse in areas where insurrectionists and the gov-
ernment forces mobilized to counteract them were most active.

Sectarian violence also increased markedly in 2007. In a total of 341 
acts of such violence, more than 440 people were killed, and 630 were 
injured. The previous year saw only 38 such incidents, resulting in 201 
deaths and 349 injuries. The problem is hardly Pakistan’s alone. More 
than 80 percent of the suicide bombers in Afghanistan are recruited and 
trained in Pakistan.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)
More than 100,000 Pakistani soldiers are deployed in FATA to fight the 
Taliban, al-Qaeda and other militant groups. More than 1,680 persons 
were killed here as a result of this battle during 2007, making this the 
second most violent subnational geographic unit in South Asia after 
Sri Lanka’s Northern Province. Though primarily affecting North and 
South Waziristan and Kurram, the violence also is felt in the other 
four agencies—Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, and Orakzai. In September 
2006 the government signed a peace agreement with tribal leaders in 
North Waziristan. This dismayed many who counted on Musharraf to 
take a strong hand against Islamic militants. Violence flared again after 
the July 2007 siege of the Lal Mosque, or Red Mosque, in Islamabad. 
A hotbed of Islamic militancy, clerics had been inciting students to 
stage antigovernment actions and engage in Islamic vigilantism, try-
ing to force the public to obey sharia, or Islamic religious laws. The 
clerics’ refusal to surrender to authorities led to the eight-day siege of 
the mosque by the army. The army’s assault on the mosque resulted in 
87 reported deaths. The public for the most part did not support the 
extremists’ position, and relatively little public demonstrations of anger 
were staged in the aftermath in most of the country. However, violence 
surged in the tribal regions, and the 10-month old cease-fire agreements 
with tribal leaders broke down.

In August militants in the tribal areas captured 242 soldiers from 
the Pakistani army. The government freed two dozen incarcerated mili-
tants to win the soldiers’ release. But alarmed at the growing lawless-
ness and loss of control over the region, in November 2007 the army 
began a large operation against militants in the Swat Valley. In January 
the army commenced a major military offensive in South Waziristan. 
However, in early February 2008 the Pakistani government and the 
Taliban agreed to a cease-fire. Again, those looking for decisive action 
against the militants—an approach many Pakistanis opposed, seeing it 
as a U.S.-driven policy—were disappointed.

NWFP
NWFP has become a major battleground for Islamic insurrectionists. 
In 2007 this conflict claimed the lives of at least 1,190 people, com-
pared to a total of 163 deaths due to such activity recorded in 2006. 
Twenty-two of the province’s 24 districts harbor various levels of 
militant activity. The NWFP is now regarded by terrorism experts as 
the heart of Islamic militant mobilization in the Pakistan-Afghanistan

region. This is all the more noteworthy as NWFP traditionally had a 
strong federal presence, unlike the largely ungoverned FATA. The pro-
cess of radicalization increased markedly since the Islamist alliance, 
the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, won an absolute majority in the provin-
cial assembly in 2002 after Musharraf reportedly rigged the election in 
their favor. The trajectory of violence in NWFP is especially troubling 
to experts, who note that past experience in South Asia has shown

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

that once antistate violence reaches a critical threshold it is difficult 
to contain or reverse.

Baluchistan
While Islamic extremists have increased their activities in recent years 
in Baluchistan, the majority of the unrest in the province is linked to 
the Baluchi nationalist movement, and there is no evidence of coop-
eration between Baluchis and either Pashtun Islamist militants, the 
Taliban, or al-Qaeda.

A revival of nationalism in Baluchistan emerged in the new century 
spearheaded by the Baluch Liberation Organization, a group possibly 
linked to the Baluch People’s Liberation Organization; the latter had led 
the uprising under Zulfikar Bhutto, who brutally suppressed the rebel-
lion. The disparity between the poor economic state of the province 
and the wealth it produced for the rest of the nation helped fuel the 
unrest. So did the lack of royalty payments to the province or its tribes 
for gas extracted from their land. In December 2004 nationalists staged 
several attacks that claimed dozens of lives across the province. Forces 
of the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary patrol, were also attacked. The 
Baluch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed credit for most of the attacks.

The BLA established guerrilla training camps for Baluch militants; 
even the government, loathe to show signs of vulnerability, admitted 
the existence of at least 15 such facilities, each reportedly with 300 to 
500 recruits. The government pursued a policy of isolating and con-
taining the nationalists in Baluchistan, though Musharraf indicated he 
was willing to take stronger measures. “Don’t push us,” he said in a 
warning to the BLA and their supporters, “This is not the 1970s, and 
this time you won’t even know what has hit you” (Rahman, 2004, 1).

Musharraf was referring to a previous Baluch insurgency that 
occurred in the aftermath of the loss of East Pakistan. The nation was 
now much more militarily powerful. But Musharraf did not have the 
popularity or support in Punjab and Sind that had allowed Bhutto to use 
his harsh tactics in Baluchistan. In addition, the involvement of military 
officers in attempts on Musharraf’s life indicated a lack of complete 
support within the armed forces. And the army was engaged in battling 
foreign fighters in South Waziristan—Arabs, Uzbeks, Chechens, and 
others—complicating any potential campaign in Baluchistan. Moreover, 
Baluchistan contains the gas fields and mineral deposits upon which 
much of the country and the economy depend; military action and 
insurgent strikes against economic targets could cripple the nation.

A Return to the world stage

The government was also constructing a new seaport in Baluchistan, 
Gwadar Port, begun under Nawaz Sharif. It was planned as an adjunct to 
Pakistan’s sole international seaport, Karachi, which had dominated as 
well as constrained the country’s maritime trade. The government relied 
on imported labor to construct the facility and other projects, another 
sore point with Baluchis, who demanded more jobs for local residents.

As of 2007 all 30 districts of Baluchistan were affected by either tribal 
insurgency or Islamist extremism or both. The tribal insurgency, driven 
by Baluchi nationalism, accounted for most of the violence. All told, 
as many as 1,170 people were killed in Baluchistan as a result of this 
activity from 2004 to 2008.

In 2006 government forces killed Akbar Khan Bugti, a Baluchi in-
surrectionist leader, one of at least 450 people killed in the province 
that year as a result of militant activity. In 2007 the level of nationalist 
violence declined, as some leaders left the country or were effectively 
neutralized by government action, and the death toll attributed to such 
violence declined to about 245. Yet despite the decline in deaths, sabo-
tage and bombings of gas pipelines, railway tracks, power transmission 
lines, bridges, communication infrastructure, and military and govern-
ment facilities were widespread.

Traditionally, the government observed “A” and “B” areas of Baluch-
istan, the former under the jurisdiction of Pakistani police, the latter 
where police do not operate. A community-based “Levies” force kept 
order in these latter areas, as they had for centuries. An experiment 
beginning in 2004 to reduce violence by allowing the police into “B” 
areas has been a failure, as crime in these areas has grown dramatically 
in the aftermath of the shift in law-enforcement strategy.

Sunni-Shi’i Violence
Between 1990 and 2005 some 1,200 people died in clashes between 
Sunni and Shi’i extremist groups in Pakistan. Sunnis make up 77 per-
cent of the country’s population and Shi’is 20 percent. The roots of 
the current violence can be traced back to the regime of Zia ul-Haq. 
A Sunni, Zia had Zulfikar Bhutto, a Shi’i whom he deposed, executed. 
Many Shi’is viewed Zia’s efforts to enhance the role of Islam in Pakistan 
as a “Sunnification” of the country, as the laws were based on Sunni 
interpretations of Islamic strictures. The Shi’i revolution in Iran that 
brought Ruhollah Khomeini (1902–89) to power in 1979 had already 
inspired the radicalization of some Shi’is in the region. As the conflict 
between the two sects intensified, Shi’is and Sunnis formed political

parties and militia groups. Meanwhile, the Taliban, a Sunni group, pro-
vided training for militants dedicated to this internecine battle.

Two prominent Sunni figures were assassinated in 2003/4: Maulana 
Azam Tariq (b. 1962), a leading militant, in fall 2003, and Mufti 
Nizamuddin Shamzai, a pro-Taliban cleric, in May 2004. Shi’i militants 
were blamed for both killings. In May 2004 a suicide bombing in a Shi’i 
mosque led to a chain of violence that claimed more than 90 lives and 
200 injuries. Police and members of the armed forces were implicated 
in some of the attacks.

Kashmir
It is estimated that the dispute in Kashmir has cost more than 50,000 
lives since 1989, when the latest cycle of violence began, and the clos-
ing years of the first decade of the 21st century (HRWF 2007).

In another effort to resolve the dispute Foreign Secretary Riaz 
Khokhar (served 2002–05) went to Delhi in late June 2004 for two 
days of discussions with Indian prime minister Vajpayee. In a show of 
good faith before the meeting began, Vajpayee had declared a cease-fire 
on the Kashmir frontier, announced the reopening of cross-border road 
links, and pledged to maintain a freeze on nuclear testing. In February 
2005 Pakistan and India agreed to establish a bus service between 
Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, the capitals of the Indian- and Pakistan-
controlled portions of Kashmir, respectively. The highway between the 
two capitals had been more or less closed since 1947, when the sub-
continent was partitioned to create Pakistan and India, separating tens 
of thousands of families.

The Kashmir bus-service agreement did not address the disputed 
Line of Control (LOC), which cuts through Kashmir. It allowed author-
ities on the two sides to issue an “entry permit” to passengers. India had 
earlier insisted on conventional passports and visas for those traveling 
across Kashmir, a practice that Pakistan rejected on the grounds that it 
would make the LOC a national border. In March 2005 a 220-foot-long 
bridge, now called the Peace Bridge, was rebuilt crossing the LOC near 
Salamabad in Indian-held Kashmir.

On April 7 the first crossing occurred. Thirty Pakistanis walked 
across from west to east to board buses for a reception in Salamabad 
before proceeding to Srinagar. About three hours later 19 Indians 
made the reverse crossing, east to west. They boarded buses bound for 
Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. Continuing 
in the spirit of rapprochement, in April Musharraf and Indian prime

minister Manmohan Singh (r. 2004– ) met in New Delhi and pledged 
to increase trade and continue their peace efforts. Before beginning 
negotiations, the two watched the first hour of a cricket match between 
their national teams together. Improved relations would enable both 
countries to cut defense expenditures. In 2004 Pakistan had spent 
about $3.7 billion, or 25 percent of its budget, on defense.

On October 8, 2005, a 7.6-magnitude earthquake centered in Pakistan-
controlled Kashmir struck the area, the worst natural disaster in the 
nation’s history. By early November the government put the death toll at 
79,000 in Pakistan. An estimated 1,400 died in Indian-controlled Kashmir, 
where more than 30,000 masonry buildings collapsed in Srinagar. At 
least 69,000 people were severely injured in the earthquake.

In the wake of the earthquake India and Pakistan agreed to open 
crossings through the Line of Control between the contested areas of 

A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE

On October 8, 2005, an earthquake registering 7.6 struck an iso-
lated mountainous area in NWFP, Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, 

and a small corner of India. It was the worst earthquake in Pakistan 
in at least a century and the worst natural disaster to befall it since 
the nation’s birth in 1947. At least 50,000 people died, and more than 
75,000 were injured. As many as 550,000 families were left homeless 
by the disaster. The government had diffi culty responding to the emer-
gency due to damage to infrastructure, limited resources, and poorly 
coordinated relief efforts. The government’s perceived failure under-
mined the legitimacy of Musharraf, who had come to power claiming 
only the military had the capability to run the government effectively. 
The slow and limited search and rescue efforts were exacerbated by 
the relatively weak response from the international community, which 
had already been overextended by the massive natural disasters that 
year, including the tsunami that swept the coast of the Indian Ocean 
and Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast of the United 
States. In the aftermath of the quake India and Pakistan made gestures 
to demonstrate mutual concern. Rules governing access to the heavily 
militarized border areas were suspended, enabling the fl ow of supplies 
and assistance. Pakistan accepted aid from its long-time enemy, but 
refused the offer of helicopters unless Pakistani crews were allowed 
to operate them, a condition that India declined to accept.

Kashmir for the first time in decades. Phone links, which had been sev-
ered since the rebellion in the Indian-controlled area 16 years before, 
were also restored.

Musharraf ’s Tenuous Hold on Power
By 2005 Pakistan was receiving $700 million annually in bilateral 
assistance and $84 million monthly from the United States to under-
write its antiterrorist efforts, as well as $1.7 billion from international 
financial institutions, secured with the support of the United States. 
By 2006 foreign reserves had risen to $16 billion, though foreign debt 
rose to $40 billion. As of the following October, the eighth anniversary 
of Musharraf’s coup, the economy had grown almost 50 percent, and 
income had risen by almost 25 percent. Throughout this eight-year 
period, GDP per capita increased at nearly twice the rate of growth of 
the population. Yet this did not greatly affect the prevalence of poverty. 
The lower classes did not see the benefits that the upper classes did, 
as the expansion came mainly from sectors that offered high returns to 
investors, such as real estate development and the modern service sec-
tor, neither of which provided much employment for the lower class. 
That same month the government was projecting a 7 percent to 8 per-
cent annual increase in GDP over the next several years, though many 
economists took this to be overly optimistic.

Musharraf worked to make the country attractive to foreign inves-
tors. However, the lack of political stability slowed international invest-
ments, as did religious fundamentalism and its anticonsumerist ethos. 
Recent examples of foreign investment include U.S. tobacco company 
Altria’s purchase of a domestic cigarette manufacturer and investments 
by consumer companies such as MacDonald’s and PepsiCo and mobile 
telephone companies from the Middle East and China. However, such 
businesses do not offer the long-term economic stability that invest-
ments in more basic industries typically provide. Moreover, Pakistan’s 
budget deficit continued growing, exports stagnated, and power short-
ages, artificial price controls, and inflation continued to plague the 
economy.

Pakistan’s economic story has been characterized as “growth without 
development.” Though per capita income increases of the last half-
century have been respectable, the country was still behind on most 
social and political indicators of progress: education, health, sanitation, 
gender equality, fertility, corruption, political instability, violence, and 
democracy.

A RETURN TO THE WORLD STAGE

The Seventeenth Amendment to the constitution had stated that, 
after December 31, 2004, the offices of president and chief of army staff 
shall not be held concurrently by the same person. However, a month 
before Musharraf was to give up his military position, the Senate chair-
man, acting as president while Musharraf was out of the country, signed 
into law a bill allowing Musharraf to continue to hold both posts. While 
the Supreme Court was considering the question of whether his current 
tenure was legal, Musharraf suspended the chief justice of the Supreme 
Court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, in March 2007 on charges of 
abuse of power and nepotism. The charges were widely viewed as an 
attack by Musharraf on the judge’s increasingly independent rulings; 
the general was thought to have feared that Chaudhry would some-
day declare unconstitutional Musharraf’s intention to be reelected as 
president while retaining his army position. The suspension sparked 
protests led by lawyers and increased calls for Musharraf’s resignation.

Increasingly under pressure and isolated, Musharraf cast about for a 
way to retain power. To tamp down public discontent, Musharraf called 
for new elections. He suggested that Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif 
might be allowed to return to Pakistan and stand for office. In July news 
that Musharraf had met Benazir Bhutto in Abu Dhabi to discuss a pos-
sible power-sharing arrangement became public. The same month the 
Supreme Court reinstated Chief Justice Chaudhry, declaring his sus-
pension illegal. In August, after the chief justice’s return, the Supreme 
Court freed one of the country’s most prominent opposition politicians, 
Javed Hashmi of the PML, whom Musharraf had jailed four years before 
for criticizing the military. In the same month it ruled Nawaz Sharif 
had an inalienable right to return to Pakistan. The Supreme Court was 
emerging as the only potential check on Musharraf’s power besides 
the military itself. With political turmoil deepening, Musharraf hinted 
he might declare a state of emergency, as allowed under the constitu-
tion, should he deem the country’s security threatened by war, external 
aggression, or internal disturbance beyond the authority of the provin-
cial government’s authority to control. 

Nawaz Sharif returned in September but was promptly arrested, 
charged with corruption, and deported to Saudi Arabia. He was allowed 
to return to Pakistan in November but was forbidden from running for 
Parliament. But he threatened to lead mass protests if emergency rule 
was not lifted.

Bhutto, whose negotiations with Musharraf had failed, returned to 
Pakistan on October 18 and began campaigning. On the eve of her 
return a presidential ordinance had granted Bhutto and other opponents

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

amnesty from all pending corruption cases in return for support for 
Musharraf’s rule for another term.

Musharraf announced he would run for president in a separate 
election in October, pledging that if elected he would give up his posi-
tion as army chief of staff. Opposition parties boycotted the election 
as unconstitutional. Musharraf was reelected to the presidency by par-
liamentary vote in the national and provincial assemblies. Opponents 
contested the constitutionality of the election and of Musharraf’s dual 
roles. The result remained in limbo pending a Supreme Court ruling 
on the issues. Meanwhile, in late November 2007 Musharraf resigned 
as army chief of staff, appointing General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani to 
the position.

With the Supreme Court poised to rule on the constitutionality of 
the presidential election and Musharraf’s rule, Musharraf declared a 
state of emergency on November 3, 2007, despite international pro-
tests. He claimed emergency rule was necessary to counter the Islamic 
militants in the tribal areas. He appointed a new Supreme Court; mean-
while, thousands of opposition-party activists, lawyers, and judges were 
arrested. The state of emergency was lifted in mid-December.

Benazir Bhutto returned from exile in October of 2007 to campaign for offi ce and promote 
her party’s candidates. Here she addresses a group of supporters during the campaign. She 
was assassinated in December while leaving a rally in Rawalpindi.

A RETURN TO THE WORLD STAGE

Bhutto had returned to London for a few days just before Musharraf 
declared emergency rule, then came back to Pakistan to resume her 
campaign. At the welcoming rally a bomb intended to assassinate her 
killed 140 people. Bhutto escaped injury and continued her political 
quest. She decried the emergency rule and the lack of decisive move-
ment against Islamic militants, and was placed repeatedly under house 
arrest. The election was scheduled for January 2008.

On December 27, 2007, Bhutto was assassinated as she left a rally 
in Rawalpindi. At least three other candidates were murdered during 
the campaign. After her assassination, Musharraf announced elections 
would be pushed back until February 18. Bhutto’s widower, Asif Ali 
Zardari, took control of the PPP, claiming he would act as caretaker 
until their son, Bilawal, finished college and could lead the party.

In a reversal of Musharraf’s practice of encouraging military involve-
ment in the government and politics, in January 2008 the new army 
chief of staff, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, ordered military officers to 
refrain from involvement in political affairs and the upcoming elections. 
In February he ordered them to withdraw from civil service positions.

National Elections of 2008
Tensions rose in the weeks leading up to the contest, as fears of election 
fraud, violence on the campaign trail, and voter intimidation grew. But 
the elections were relatively calm. The results were a resounding defeat 
for Musharraf and his party, the PML-Q, which won only 38 seats out of 
the 272 in the National Assembly. At least 10 of its ministers and senior 
leaders also lost their seats.

The MMA, the coalition of six religious parties, was also soundly 
defeated, winning just 5 seats. The PPP, headed by Zardari, won the 
most seats, and the PML, headed by Nawaz Sharif, came in second. 
Together the two parties gained 171 seats. Needing a two-thirds majority 
to change the constitution and weaken Musharraf’s powers as president, 
the two parties began discussions on forming a coalition government.

The major issue dividing the two parties involved the reinstatement 
of the 60 dismissed judges, whose removal by Musharraf had been 
one of the lightning rods for opposition to his regime. Sharif and the 
PML sought the judges’ immediate reinstatement. The PPP preferred to 
avoid a confrontation with Musharraf they felt an immediate reinstate-
ment would likely provoke. Moreover, Chaudhry, the dismissed chief 
justice, had previously raised issues about the legality of the pardon 
Musharraf had granted Benazir Bhutto and Zardari for corruption and 

277

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

other charges, which had allowed them to return to Pakistan without 
facing arrest. The PPP’s concern about Chaudhry’s position on the 
pardon likely affected the party’s position on the cashiered judges’ 
reinstatement. The two parties were unable to reach an agreement on 
the issue and, in May, the PML withdrew from the cabinet, though at 
the time party officials said it would continue to support the coalition 
government. Though the PPP–PML partnership was unsuccessful, the 
brief alliance marked the first time Pakistan’s two main parties joined 
to provide civilian rule.

One of the most immediate results of the election was a new policy 
toward Pakistani militants in the tribal areas and NWFP. Whereas 
Musharraf had sent in army troops in an effort to root out home grown 
and foreign militants (though his level of commitment to this effort 
was a subject of longstanding debate), the new government sought 
a truce with them. Opposition to Musharraf’s military approach was 
widespread, in part because it was seen as an affront to Pakistani sover-
eignty, a policy set in Washington rather than Islamabad. In April 2008 
the government began negotiations with leaders of Pashtun tribes that 
historically had controlled the areas where militants linked to al-Qaeda

operated. That same month the government announced a tentative 
accord with the militant groups. The agreement would require tribes 
to expel foreign militants, cease attacks and kidnappings, and allow 
the Frontier Corps, the government’s local security force, freedom of 
movement in the region. It also called for an exchange of prisoners 
and the gradual withdrawal of Pakistani military forces from part of the 
tribal region in South Waziristan. But it held no promise of reining in 
militant activity. In June Baitullah Mehsud, leader of Tehrik-e-Taliban, 
a coalition of militant groups. who was himself accused of involvement 
in the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, vowed to continue mounting 
cross-border raids to fight against NATO forces in Afghanistan in sup-
port of the Taliban.

The United States continued trying to blunt the militant activity on 
its own. In May a house in the border region was destroyed by what was 
believed to be a missile fired from a drone aircraft operated by the United 
States. It was at least the third site known to be used by al-Qaeda opera-
tives struck by missiles from drones. However, neither Pakistan nor the 
United States would confirm that such attacks took place. In July, U.S. 
president George W. Bush authorized military operations by U.S. ground 
forces in Pakistan without the approval of the Pakistani government. 
In September, Special Operations forces carried out the first publicly 
acknowledged ground raid in Pakistan. Attacks on suspected militant 
targets in Pakistan by U.S. drone aircraft also increased. Charges by 
Pakistanis and independent monitors that attacks by missiles fired from 
drone aircraft frequently killed civilians exacerbated anti-U.S. sentiment 
in the country. Violence wrought by militants in other areas of Pakistan 
also continued. In June a suicide car bomber attacked the Danish 
embassy in Islamabad, killing at least six people. The target was thought 
to be chosen because in February Danish newspapers had reprinted car-
toons considered insulting to the prophet Muhammad.

The Pakistan government’s degree of control over the ISI, and the 
ISI’s involvement in attacks carried out by militants in Afghanistan also 
came to the fore at this time. U.S. and Afghan intelligence agencies 
concluded that ISI operatives were involved in a July bombing of the 
Indian embassy in Kabul that killed 58 people, as well as in a bombing 
that targeted Afghanistan’s president, Hamid Karzai, in April. 

When Pakistan’s prime minister (from 2008– ), Yousaf Raza Gilani, 
visited the United States in late July, administration officials pressed him 
to exert greater control over the ISI. Gilani publicly denied charges that 
the ISI assisted or colluded with Islamic militants. Yet on the eve of his 
visit, Pakistan issued a memorandum stating the ISI would henceforth

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

report to the civilian officials in the Interior Ministry, rather than to the 
military. However, the following day, the government reversed the new 
policy, reportedly due to objections from the ISI, stating its announce-
ment had been misinterpreted and that the government would simply 
improve its coordination with the ISI. 

Meanwhile, in the wake of the bombing of India’s embassy in 
Afghanistan and several cease-fire violations along the Line of Control 
in Kashmir, relations between India and Pakistan sank to their lowest 
level since the two countries came to the brink of war in 2003, accord-
ing to statements by Indian officials. 

Relations with the United States had also grown more strained due 
to unwavering American support for president Pervez Musharraf; U.S. 
officials viewed Musharraf as a more reliable foe of terrorism than 
coalition leaders Nawaz Sharif or Asif Ali Zardari, despite whatever 
lack of commitment to democracy Musharraf evinced while in office 
and despite the rejection of his government by Pakistani voters in the 
2008 election.

Pakistan’s fractious ruling coalition, widely seen as ineffectual in 
its first months in office, harnessed its fragile unity to move toward 
impeaching president Musharraf. Lacking support, Musharraf resigned 
in late August of 2008 rather than face impeachment. Shortly after his 
resignation the PML(N), which had already withdrawn from the cabinet 
over a dispute with the PPP about reinstatement of the Supreme Court 
justices the president had fired, left the coalition. The PML(N) wanted 
the justices reinstated; the PPP resisted restoring the justices, perhaps 
fearing they would overturn the amnesty for corruption charges the 
replacement justices granted Zardari.

Zardari was elected president of Pakistan in September and pledged 
to improve relations with Afghanistan. His administration also prom-
ised to eliminate the constitutional provision that allowed the president 
to dismiss Parliament. Whatever its intentions, Zardari’s government 
faced significant challenges in bringing Pakistan the stability that has 
eluded the country for most of its history.

Looking Ahead
One of the most fundamental questions of Pakistan’s future is whether 
it can exist as a democracy. Stable political institutions never had a 
chance to take root in the nation’s first turbulent years. The country’s 
political father, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, died only 13 months after the 
country’s founding in 1947. His closest associate and political heir was

assassinated four years later, setting a precedent for political upheaval 
that has afflicted Pakistan ever since.

Pakistan is united by history and religion and rightly wears its 
independence with pride. But there are strong countervailing trends, 
groups, and attitudes working against the integration of its myriad parts 
into a greater whole. Ethnic and sectarian violence and a congenital 
inability of political institutions to function for the benefit of those they 
represent are ongoing problems.

The battle between militant and more moderate strains of Islam will 
be a major factor in future government policy. What constitutes prog-
ress and equality to the latter group represents apostasy and damnation 
to the former. Is there a possibility that these divisions will plunge the 
country into civil war?

Relations with India have warmed, but Kashmir remains a flashpoint 
ever ready to push the two countries into war. In the past, progress 
on forging normal relations between the two countries has been easily 
undone by violence wrought by small groups opposed to any negoti-
ated settlement that stops short of delivering all the concessions they 
seek. And with their nuclear arsenals, a crisis could quickly spiral out 
of control. Will both governments be more cautious about their rheto-
ric and actions now that they could end in a nuclear confrontation?

And how will Pakistan address the poverty and lack of education that 
still afflicts so many of its people, or the endemic corruption that has 
undermined faith in its governmental institutions? Can democracy of 
the model Pakistan has developed, even if free of military interference, 
rise to meet these challenges? Or will the repeated bouts of military rule 
lead to some more permanent form of autocracy?

And what will happen if and when the United States’s emphasis 
on the War on Terror wanes, or the government refuses to take part 
in it? Can Pakistan meet its internal challenges without the support 
and assistance of the United States? And what if the tacit approval for 
authoritarianism the United States has long extended to a succession of 
regimes around the world ends, and assistance only comes at the price 
of meaningful democratic reforms?

Yet Pakistan has resources to retain its newfound position of impor-
tance, filled as it is with the energy and determination that are increas-
ingly the currency of a flattened world.

Economy
For much of its history Pakistan’s economy has been hobbled by the 
lack of internal political disputes, low levels of foreign investment, 
government mismanagement, corruption, and the costs associated 
with its long-standing disputes with its neighbor India. In 2002 the 
economy began a recovery due to changes in government policies and 
the resumption of international lending. The Musharraf government 
continued a process of economic liberalization that began in the 1980s. 
Privatization of government-owned industries, deregulation of the pri-
vate sector, and financial reforms have spurred growth internally. The 
alliance with the United States and its allies in the global war on ter-
rorism has stimulated economic assistance from the United States and 
foreign investment. The government’s development spending, which 
equaled about 2 percent of the GDP (gross domestic product) in the 
1990s, grew to 4 percent in 2003. During the same period, industrial 
production achieved double-digit annual growth. Dependence on the 
agricultural sector declined. Foreign reserves reached record levels 
in 2004 due to strong exports and remittances from Pakistanis work-
ing abroad. The nation’s unreported economic activity is estimated to 
account for as much as 30 percent of the economy.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF PAKISTAN

China (Aksai Chin), India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad 
Kashmir and Northern Areas). The UN Military Observer Group in 
India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) has maintained a small group of 
peacekeepers along the Line of Control since 1949. India does not rec-
ognize Pakistan’s ceding of historic Kashmir lands to China in 1964. In 
2004 India and Pakistan instituted a cease-fire in Kashmir and in 2005 
restored bus service across the highly militarized Line of Control.

Pakistan has taken its dispute on the impact of India’s building of the 
Baglihar Dam on the Chenab River in Jammu and Kashmir to the World 
Bank for arbitration; in general the two states still dispute Indus River 
water sharing. To defuse tensions and prepare discussions on a mari-
time boundary, in 2004 India and Pakistan resurveyed a portion of the 
disputed Sir Creek estuary at the mouth of the Rann of Kutch. Pakistani 
maps continue to show the Junagadh claim in India’s Gujarat State.

By 2005 Pakistan, with UN assistance, had repatriated 2.3 million 
Afghan refugees and had undertaken a census to count the remaining 
million or more, many of whom remain at their own choosing. Pakistan 
has sent troops into remote tribal areas to control the border with 
Afghanistan and stem organized terrorist or other illegal cross-border 
activities. Meetings with Afghan and Coalition allies have taken place 
regularly to resolve periodic claims of boundary encroachments.
